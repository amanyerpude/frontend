## System Design Explained for Frontend Engineers

The provided source is an excerpt from the transcript of a YouTube video titled "System Design Explained for Frontend Engineers" by **Dimma (Dmitriy Zhiganov)**. Dimma is a **senior front-end developer from Berlin** with **more than seven years of experience** in different companies.

### I. General Context and Relevance of the Course

The video serves as an introduction to Dimma's course.

**A. Course and Video Focus:** The video discusses the system design interview in general, focusing on:

- How to prepare for and successfully pass the front-end system design interview.
- Why preparing for the system design stage is important.
- How to prepare for it and which resources to use.
- What types of system design rounds exist.
- The main differences between full stack and front end system design.
- Many other topics.
- The overall goal of the course is to teach viewers how to pass the system design interview stage.

**B. Prevalence of System Design Interviews:**

- System design interviews are common in **many big tech companies**.
- Nowadays, this practice is **not just limited to big tech**; small and medium-sized companies are also incorporating it into their hiring process.
- Examples of well-known tech companies in Berlin that include system design interviews are **Zelando** and **N26**.
- Whether a company is midsized or larger, they often include a system design interview.

**C. Target Audience and Role Expectations:**

- If you are applying for a **mid-level role** or especially for **senior and above**, you will almost certainly encounter some form of a system design interview.
- If you are aiming for a **start mid-level role**, there is still a high chance you will face a system design related task.
- The course is designed for those preparing for a system design interview, particularly **mid-level or senior front-end developers** who want to learn how to build scalable and robust web applications and advance their career by learning front-end architecture.

**D. Who the Course Might NOT Be For:**

- **Junior developers** still learning the basics. In this case, it is recommended to focus on foundational programming skills and return to system design later.
- Those looking for a **deep dive into specific front-end frameworks** like React or Vue. While specific tools like **React, Vue, web frameworks, databases, and cloud providers** will be mentioned to illustrate key concepts (e.g., referencing **View Query** for client-side caching), the course is about high-level knowledge and architectural principles, not teaching specific tools.

### II. Economic Landscape, AI, and Career Growth

**A. Economic Instability and Layoffs:**

- The current economic situation is very **unstable**, and there have been **massive layoffs**, especially in big tech companies.
- This trend of layoffs is **happening across the industry**, including smaller companies, though media attention focuses primarily on big tech due to their size.
- Even if a developer is not actively interviewing, they should still sharpen their skills to ensure they remain a valuable developer in the job market.

**B. Impact of AI on Developer Roles:**

- There is a noticeable **trend of declining demand for junior developer roles**.
- This is partly due to the overall economic situation and is **closely tied to the rapid advancement of AI tools**.
- Companies now need **fewer developers than before**.
- It makes more sense to hire **one strong senior developer** and leverage AI tools to speed up manual tasks, rather than hiring multiple junior developers.
- AI tools still struggle with areas like **communication, cross-team collaboration, and high-level system design**.
- AI cannot replace the role of a senior developer or architect because it is currently not capable of making effective **strategic decisions**, understanding **business needs**, or effectively **coordinating between teams**.

**C. Staying Competitive:** For junior and mid-level developers, the best way to stay competitive is to improve skills in two key areas:

1. Learn how to work effectively with **AI tools** to automate and accelerate repetitive tasks.
2. Develop **strong system design skills**.

**D. System Design as a Career Accelerator:**

- System design is a **crucial skill for senior and above developers**.
- It is not just about the initial phase of the project, but also about **long-term development and evolution**.
- As projects grow, they need to be **improved, restructured, or scaled**.
- Senior developers are typically involved in **upgrading infrastructure, refining architecture, and launching new services**.
- If a developer lacks system design skills, they will **never be asked to work on these tasks** or even be considered for them.
- The goal for competitive growth is to **move up to senior and beyond as quickly as possible**.

### III. Definition and Scope of System Design

**A. What System Design Is:** System design is the process of planning how **different software components work together** to meet specific requirements.

- It is **not about isolated solutions**.
- It is about **choosing tools and technologies that integrate well with each other** to form a complex system.
- The main goal is to meet the system requirements while ensuring **all components work well together**.

**B. Types of Applications:** Applications are generally divided into two main types:

1. **Backend applications**.
2. **Front-end applications**.

**C. Expanding Scope with Seniority:**

- If you are interviewing as a **back-end developer**, you will most likely be asked to design a back-end system.
- If you are a **front-end developer**, you will be asked to design a front-end application.
- As you move up in seniority, the scope of system design expands.
    - A **mid-level front-end developer** interview will mostly focus on front-end system design.
    - A **senior or above front-end developer** has a high chance of being asked about **basic back-end topics** or even **infrastructure related topics**.
- Similarly, the more senior a back-end developer becomes, the more they are expected to understand **infrastructure, database design, security, and other advanced topics**.

**D. Preparation Focus (Front-end vs. Back-end):**

- **Front-end Developers** should focus primarily on front-end system design, but must have a **basic understanding of how back-end systems work**.
- **Back-end System Design** is well-documented with countless courses and resources, usually including topics like **scalability, application reliability, and performance optimizations**.
- **Front-end System Design** key topics include **client-server communication** and **state management on the client side**.

### IV. System Design Skills: Experience vs. Theory

System design consists of both **experience** and **theoretical knowledge**.

**A. Experience:**

- Allows you to go deep into specific topics.
- Example: Specializing in high-performance web applications (like publicly available websites serving millions of users daily, such as **Amazon**) provides deep expertise in **performance optimizations, accessibility, and legalization**.
- However, no matter how many years of experience you have, you **cannot have experience in everything**.

**B. Theoretical Knowledge:**

- Means understanding key concepts of system design, even without having worked on them directly.
- Allows for quick adaptation to new challenges.
- Example: If asked to design a real-time market application (a common topic), understanding **WebSockets**, their usefulness, and alternatives (like **long polling** or **server-sent events**) allows you to propose and justify design decisions.

**C. The T-Shaped Specialist:** The combination of **deep experience in some areas** and **broad theoretical knowledge across many areas** is what is called a **T-shaped specialist**.

### V. Impact on Job Level and Salary

- Performance in the system design interview often determines your **starting position and salary**.
- For **junior and mid-level positions**, successfully passing the coding round (e.g., LeetCode style problems or take-home assignments) often secures the job.
- For **senior and above positions**, failing the system design round will likely prevent you from getting the job, even if you passed the coding round.
- If you do not completely fail, but demonstrate weak system design skills, the company might offer a **lower seniority level and salary**.
- Performing well in the system design round can secure a **higher level with a better salary from day one**.
- System design knowledge is **directly applicable to your actual job**, unlike complex graph algorithms sometimes tested in coding challenges. Passing the system design interview means you are prepared for real-world engineering work.

### VI. Goal of the Interview: Positive and Negative Signals

The goal of the system design interview is to demonstrate **as many positive signals as possible** while **avoiding negative signals**.

#### A. Positive Signals (Green Flags):

|Signal|Description|Example|
|:--|:--|:--|
|**Thinking at a High Level of Abstraction**|Think like a **tech leader**, focusing on the **entire system** rather than individual components.|When suggesting React, consider integration with the design system, required UI components, and performance requirements, rather than just saying "I will use React".|
|**Showing Both Broad Theoretical Knowledge and Deep Expertise**|System design requires both experience and theory.|Start explaining the system at a high level, then dive deeper into specific areas when necessary, and return to the high-level discussion (like a **straight line with deep dives** on a graph).|
|**Always Considering Tradeoffs**|Discuss the advantages and **downsides** of every major decision.|If proposing WebSockets, mention the advantages (real-time communication) but also potential issues like **server load, scalability, and fallback options** (e.g., long polling).|
|**Asking Clarifying Questions**|Show that you understand the business side of the system, not just the technical side.|**Never assume** you know everything up front.|
|**Cooperating with the Interviewer**|Think of the interviewer as a **stakeholder or product manager**.|They are defining the business needs.|
|**Being Honest**|If you lack real experience in a topic, admit it. Mention if you have studied it, worked on a personal project, or read about it.|
|**Talking Through Decisions**|Explain _why_ you are making a choice (e.g., why use SSR), including the thinking process, tradeoffs, and reasoning.|

#### B. Negative Signals (Red Flags):

|Signal|Description|
|:--|:--|
|**Low-Level Focus**|Spending the entire interview explaining one component in detail, which signals a failure to see the bigger picture.|
|**Narrow Technical Knowledge**|Only talking about a specific tool (e.g., React) instead of thinking like a tool-agnostic web developer or software engineer.|
|**Ignoring Trade-offs**|Discussing only the positive sides of a solution without mentioning its downsides, showing a lack of full evaluation.|
|**Jumping Straight to Design**|Starting to draw architecture without asking clarifying questions, suggesting assumptions instead of rational thought.|
|**Arguing with the Interviewer**|System design is collaborative. If challenged, show openness to feedback.|
|**Ignoring Key Questions or Prompts**|Brushing off important topics raised by the interviewer (e.g., scalability).|
|**Pretending to be an Expert**|Faking expertise is discouraged. It is better to admit lack of experience in enterprise apps but discuss theoretical knowledge.|
|**Staying Silent for Too Long**|Long pauses make it seem like you don't know what you are doing. If thinking, **think out loud**.|

### VII. Five Main Parts of a Typical System Design Interview

A typical system design interview consists of five main parts:

|Part|Description|Front-end Focus|
|:--|:--|:--|
|**1. Collecting Requirements**|The first and most important stage. Discuss the application's goal and key requirements with the interviewer. **Avoid jumping straight into architecture**.|Clarifying requirements helps design a solution that meets business needs.|
|**2. High-Level Architecture**|Drawing the high-level architecture of the application. **Avoid focusing too much on individual components**.|Show how different parts interact, which modules are connected, and what services are used (a **blueprint**).|
|**3. Data Modeling**|If designing a front-end system, you likely **won't deal with databases** (unless it's a full-stack position).|Focus on defining **key entities** that the application will use and how they relate (e.g., in a to-do app: user entity, to-do entity, list of to-dos).|
|**4. API Design**|Focuses on how different parts of the system communicate.|Discuss client-server interaction, the data exchanged (front-end to back-end), API design (considering **REST, GraphQL, WebSockets**), data formats (**JSON** or otherwise), and **error handling and response structure**.|
|**5. Additional Considerations**|This part may be optional and depends on the application type.|Common topics include **performance, accessibility, localization/translations, and offline first strategies**. Performance and accessibility are the two most universal topics.|

### VIII. Types of System Design Questions and Interviews

#### A. Types of System Design Questions:

1. **Designing an Entire Application:**
    
    - This is the broader type of system design question.
    - Applications are typically large and complex (e.g., **Google Calendar, flashcard application, video streaming service**).
    - Expectation: Focus on **high-level design** rather than getting lost in the details of specific components.
2. **Designing a Specific Feature:**
    
    - Focuses on a key feature of a large application (e.g., **newsfeed logic** or a **data grid component**).
    - This is a major component that can take up the entire interview session.
    - Example: Focusing only on the core newsfeed functionality, not post editing or comments.
    - Expectation: Likely expected to go **deeper into internal workings, performance considerations, and accessibility optimizations** rather than client-server communication. Focus is on how the component works efficiently within a system.

#### B. Types of Front-End System Design Interviews:

1. **Pure Front-end System Design:**
    
    - Entirely focused on front-end topics.
    - Expect deep dives into things like **performance, accessibility, localization**, and other front-end specific concerns.
    - May involve designing complex UI solutions (e.g., **infinity scroll** or **efficient rendering strategies**).
    - Requires understanding how to optimize rendering, reduce layout shifts, and improve perceived performance across **different browsers and devices**.
2. **Front-end Plus API Design:**
    
    - Primarily focused on the front end, but requires thinking about **client-server communications**.
    - Involves designing an API, modeling data for API responses, and explaining front-end/back-end communication.
    - Example: Designing a dashboard that fetches data from a back end through the API, requiring definition of API structure, returned data, and efficient consumption.
3. **Full Stack System Design:**
    
    - Mostly for **full stack or senior and above engineers**.
    - Requires designing **both the front end and back end**.
    - Due to time constraints, deep dives into both sides are usually avoided.
    - Typically, the developer provides a **high-level overview of both front end and back end**, focusing more on **how they interact** rather than implementation details.

### IX. Clarifying Requirements (The Crucial First Step)

**A. Importance of Clarification:** Not clarifying requirements is one of the biggest mistakes, as misunderstanding them can lead to wasting time and failing the interview. The first goal is to get clarity on requirements as early as possible.

**B. Three Types of Requirements:**

1. **Functional Requirements (The "What"):**
    
    - Define **what the application should do** (core features).
    - Without these, the application wouldn't make sense.
    - Examples:
        - Social media app: Users should be able to **create and edit posts**.
        - Music streaming service: Users should be able to **listen to music and create playlists**.
        - Calendar app: Users should be able to **schedule meetings and share their calendars**.
2. **Nonfunctional Requirements (The "How"):**
    
    - Define **how the application should work**.
    - Examples:
        - **Performance** (e.g., UI should load in under one second).
        - **Accessibility**.
        - **Localization** (does the app need to support multiple languages).
    - This category can also include **nice-to-have but non-critical features** (e.g., offline mode).
3. **Out of the Scope (The "What We're Not Covering"):**
    
    - This is the **most overlooked part**.
    - It is crucial to clarify what is being excluded to avoid misalignment with the interviewer's expectations.
    - Example: Assuming user notification is out of scope when the interviewer expects it.
    - A good approach is to explicitly state exclusions (e.g., "I assume modification and authorization are out of the scope") and confirm with the interviewer ("Does that sound good?").

**C. Confirmation Technique:** Once requirements are collected, repeat them back to the interviewer to double-check understanding and avoid surprises. Example phrasing: "Just to make sure we're aligned, here's what I understand...".

**D. Senior vs. Mid-level Mindset (The WebSockets Example):**

- A common mistake mid-level developers make is focusing only on the **happy path**.
- When faced with a need for real-time communication, a **mid-level engineer** might simply say, "Let's use WebSockets and move on".
- A **senior engineer** would ask deeper questions (critical thinking), such as:
    - What are the **trade-offs** of using WebSockets?
    - What is the **cost** of maintaining persistent connections?
    - Are there **alternative solutions** (like Server-Sent Events or long polling)?
    - How do we handle **reconnections** if a user loses connection?

### X. Specific Behaviors and Clarifying Questions

**A. Assessing Performance (Signals):** Performance is measured by **green flags (good signals that add scores)** and **red flags (bad signals that take scores away)**.

**B. Clarifying Questions Strategy:**

- Clarifying questions are essential because you **almost never get all the details up front**.
- The interviewer is testing how well you define scope.
- You should always ask at least **two to five clarifying questions**—not too many, not too few.
- Asking good clarifying questions demonstrates your **seniority** by showing you think about real-world challenges.

**C. Examples of Good Clarifying Questions:**

- Do we need to support **emerging markets**?
- Does the app need to be **localized and translated**?
- How much data do we **expect**?
- How often is the data **updated**?
- Should users be able to **download metadata files**?

### XI. Preparation Recommendations

**A. Practice Designing Applications:**

- Strongly recommended: Design **real-world applications from scratch**.
- Examples of apps to design: **Figma, Google Calendar, web version of Skype**, or any other application you like.
- The speaker notes this technique helped him a lot and he did it at least **10 times** before interviewing.
- Some real-world examples are covered on the speaker’s YouTube channel.

**B. Research Company-Specific Questions:**

- If targeting a specific company (e.g., **Google, Microsoft, Amazon**), research what they typically ask.
- **Useful resources** for research include **Team Blind, LeetCode discussion forums, Glassdoor, and Reddit**.
- Recommended strategy: Choose **four to five companies** you are interested in and find their typical approach to the system design round.

**C. Examples of Common System Design Questions Found in Sources:**

- **Facebook and Meta:** Design newsfeed, including infin(ite) scroll.
- **Microsoft:** Google Calendar-like scheduling system, payment system, or flashcards.
- **Amazon:** App store architecture.
- **Apple:** Video streaming service architecture.

**D. Mock Interviews and Tools:**

- After designing systems on your own, test yourself with **real-world interview practice**.
- **Good platforms** for system design preparation include **Interviewing.io, Exponent, Prepfully, and Judy**.
- The speaker had two good experiences and one bad experience on **Prepfully**, noting that the experience depends on the interviewer you are paired with.
- Use AI tools (e.g., **ChatGPT** or any other AI tool) for system design preparation, which can be useful for **brainstorming solutions, getting feedback, and practicing different system designs**.

**E. Summary of Preparation:** The best way to prepare is to:

1. Practice designing real-world applications from scratch.
2. Research company-specific entry questions.
3. Do mock interviews to simulate real scenarios.
4. **Never assume a technology is a silver bullet**.
5. Use AI and online platforms to refine system design skills.
