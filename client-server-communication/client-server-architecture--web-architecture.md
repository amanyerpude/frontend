## Overview of Client-Server Architecture (Chirag Goel, Ep. 8)

The video, presented by Chirag Goel, discusses client-server architecture, using the analogy of setting up a small samosa business and scaling it into a large restaurant. The discussion covers definitions of the client, server, front-end, back-end, database, and web server, and explores various types of client-server architecture, including **one tier, two tier, three tier, and n tier architecture**.

### I. Core Technical Definitions

The system is visualized as having two main components: the front-end and the back-end.

|Component|Description|Citation|
|:--|:--|:--|
|**User**|The person who uses the system.||
|**Client**|The interface the user utilizes to make requests. Examples of web clients include the **browser**, **mobile apps** (Android/iOS), or a web application.||
|**Server**|The entity that receives a request from the client and sends a response. Servers are generally kept outside the local machine for accessibility when the system is running.||
|**Request**|The technical term for an order (e.g., requesting two samosas).||
|**Response**|The technical term for receiving the item back (e.g., getting the samosas).||
|**API**|Application Programming Interface (The Waiter). It is responsible for making a connection and facilitating communication between the client and server. **Crucially, APIs handle requests and responses not only between client and server but also between server and server**.||
|**Front-End**|The part that is **front facing** for all users. Users come, sit, order, eat, and leave here.||
|**Back-End**|Everything that happens **behind the scene** which the user doesn't know about. The database is included in the back-end.||

### II. Types of Client-Server Architecture (Tier Examples)

The source uses the samosa business analogy to explain the progression of architecture tiers.

#### 1. One Tier Architecture (Samosa Stall)

- **Definition:** All work is done in one place.
- **Example Process:** Samosas are made there, kept there, showcased there, eaten there, and all accounting work is done there.
- **Drawback:** This model is not good for growing the business, as "good clients" will not come, limiting growth potential.

#### 2. Two Tier Architecture (Small Restaurant)

- **Goal:** To resolve the problems of the one-tier system and attract more and better clients.
- **Implementation:** A small seating arrangement is made where people sit, order, eat, and go.
- **Flow:** The user (sitting/eating) is the client, and their order (request) is handled by the waiter (API) and fulfilled by the stall/kitchen (server), resulting in the samosa (response).

#### 3. Three Tier Architecture (Distribution and Specialization)

- **Goal:** To enhance the system by converting it into 3 tier, meaning the responsibilities are distributed. This involves **separation of concern**.
- **Implementation:** A new layer for **accounting** is introduced.
- **Flow:** The user pays the amount first. The payment and order go to the service.
- **Server Specialization:** The single server is split into specialized servers:
    - **Account Server:** Useful only for accounting.
    - **Samosa Server:** Dedicated only to providing samosas.
- **Communication Pathway:** The client requests the Account Server, which then requests the Samosa Server. The Samosa Server returns the order, and the Account Server finally communicates back to the client. The waiter (API) is now working in multiple places (going to the account, taking samosa back).

#### 4. N Tier Architecture (Introducing the Database)

- **Enhancement:** A problem is identified where samosa making and storage are still in one place (the server).
- **Solution:** A new layer, visualized as a **factory**, is introduced to make and store samosas.
- **Technical Term:** This factory/storage layer is the **Database**.
- **Database Function:** The database stores the samosas/data. The server requests the database for data, gets the samosas, and finally serves the client.
- **Visual Representation:** The database is generally represented pictorially like a cylinder, while the server is a simple layer.
- **N-Tier Definition:** With the client, the Account Server, the Samosa Server, and the Database, an **N-Tier architecture** is created (four tiers in this example).
- **Scaling:** N-tier architecture allows for scaling, accommodating other services or servers that keep information and handle computation. For instance, static information like cutleries and napkins can be stored in different servers.
