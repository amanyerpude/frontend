- What and When
    - Realtime updates usually means that we want to update UI in real time. near real time or sometimes periodically.
    - When do we need real-time updates ?
        - Chat applications
        - Online Games
        - Stock applications
        - Collaborative tools (e.g. Google Documents, Figma)
- Poll and Push Strategies
    - Poll is when the client requests updates from the server (Long/Shot Polling).
    - Push is when the server sends messages to the client (SSE, WS).
- What is Comet ?
    - Comet is an umbrella term, which includes techniques and technologies that allows to create a long-hold HTTP connection and push messages from server to the client. It includes long polling, SSE and others.
- How typical tutorial on Medium looks like ?
    - Short polling - very ineffective , don’t use it.
    - Long polling - use it when the browser does not support WebSockets.
    - Server Sent Events - it’s good technology, but nobody uses it.
    - WebSocket - provides bi-directional connection, it’s very effective.
- Why the above assumptions may be not true ?
    - WebSockets is a bi-directional connection, at first. It was designed to work in certain cases, which we’ll discuss about later. It is not a universal tool.
    - Why can’t I just use WebSockets every time I need real-time updates ?
        - You can! However It may not be wise to do so. Designing web applications is not only about efficiency (making it as fast as possible). It’s also about trade-offs. We can’t just pick WebSockets and not care about how many resources we’ll need for development and maintain.
        - A simple analogy : we could build a static one-page site in React, but is it worth it ? Here it is pretty much the same thing.
- Examples that may confuse :
    - For example, LinkedIn uses Server sent Events for instant messaging
        - Why not use Web Sockets ?
    - StackOverflow uses WebSockets to update the interface in real time (new posts in the feed).
        - We don’t need a bi-directional connection. Why not use Server Sent Events or polling ?
- Why is it important ?
    - You have been assigned to design a Stock application. What will you use to update data in real time ? (asked by interviewer)
