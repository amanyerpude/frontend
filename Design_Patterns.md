⚡ Flow explanation:

- **Creational** first → easiest entry point.
    
- **Structural** next → shows how to assemble bigger systems from parts.
    
- **Behavioral** → more abstract, focuses on communication patterns.
    
- **Advanced/System** → real-world performance & resilience (Object Pool, Circuit Breaker).
    

Would you like me to also add **tags for each pattern** (like `#creational`, `#structural`, `#behavioral`, `#system`) so in Obsidian you can quickly filter/search patterns by type?
