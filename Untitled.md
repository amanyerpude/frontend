Perfect 👍  
I’ll apply the same Obsidian-ready **learning roadmap** format, sequencing from **fundamental web attacks → authentication/authorization → advanced exploits → best practices**.

Here’s the final output for **Web Security**:

```markdown
# 🔒 Web Security (14 Topics) – Learning Roadmap

## 1. Web Security Essentials (Basics → Common Attacks → Advanced Exploits → Best Practices)
1. Cross-site scripting (XSS)  
2. Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)  
3. XML External Entity (XEE)  
4. Authentication and its best practices  
5. Authorization and its best practices  
6. Denial of Service (DDOS)  
7. CORS attack  
8. Cross-frame scripting  
9. Code Injection  
10. Prototype pollution attacks  
11. Server-side request forgery (SSRF)  
12. Session management and its best practices 🆕  
13. CSP directives and its secure implementation  
14. Keeping web safe and secure

⚡ Flow is **attack-first → protection-after**:

- Learner sees _what can go wrong (XSS, CSRF, XEE, injections)_
    
- Then _how to secure it (auth, session mgmt, CSP, best practices)_
    

Do you want me to also create a **“Master Web Security Checklist.md”** version where each item has sub-bullets like ✅ _what to do_ and ❌ _what to avoid_, so it becomes actionable in Obsidian?
