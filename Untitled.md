⚡ Flow explanation:

- Start with **fun coding problems** (tic tac toe, circles).
    
- Move to **building blocks (UI components)**.
    
- Add **user experience patterns (animations, effects, interactions)**.
    
- Scale into **complex reusable components** (file explorer, snack bar, walkthrough).
    
- End with **real-world performance & system-level design** (feature flags, portals, large datasets).
    

Do you want me to also **tag each component** in Obsidian with `#ui`, `#ux`, `#game`, `#performance`, etc. so you can filter them by type?
