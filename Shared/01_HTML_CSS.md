## **01. CSS Pseudo-elements: `::after`**

### 📌 **Question**

What will the following CSS code do?

```css
h1::after {
  content: "Hello World";
}
```

---

### 🔍 **Points to Discuss**

- Purpose of the `::after` pseudo-element
    
- Where `"Hello World"` will appear when applied to an `<h1>` element
    
- Practical use cases of `::after` (e.g., adding decorative content)
    

---

### ✅ **How to Analyse the Question**

The interviewer is testing:

- Understanding of **pseudo-elements** (`::before`, `::after`)
    
- How the **`content` property** works
    
- Real-world **use cases of pseudo-elements**
    

They may also check if you know that:

- `::after` only **visually adds content**; it doesn’t modify the DOM.
    
- The pseudo-element **renders only if the `content` property is defined**.
    

---

### 💡 **How to Answer in the Interview**

#### 🔹 **What `::after` Does**

> "`::after` is a CSS pseudo-element that inserts content **after an element’s content**, without modifying the HTML structure. It is always used with the `content` property."

---

#### 🔹 **What This Code Will Do**

> The code will **visually insert “Hello World” right after the text of every `<h1>` element**.
> 
> Example:
> 
> ```html
> <h1>Welcome</h1>
> ```
> 
> Will render as:  
> **WelcomeHello World**

_(“Hello World” is **not added to the DOM**, it is purely visual.)_

---

#### 🔹 **Example Use Cases**

- Adding icons or labels without changing HTML:
    
    ```css
    a::after {
      content: " ↗";
    }
    ```
    
    Shows an arrow icon for external links.
    
- Adding badges or decorative text dynamically.
    
- Styling quotes:
    
    ```css
    blockquote::before { content: "“"; }
    blockquote::after { content: "”"; }
    ```
    

---

### 🎯 **Sample Interview Answer**

> "`::after` is a pseudo-element that lets you insert content visually after an element’s content.  
> In this example, every `<h1>` will display `Hello World` right after its text.  
> For instance, `<h1>Welcome</h1>` will render as `WelcomeHello World`.
> 
> It doesn’t add a new DOM element but injects visual content using CSS.  
> A common use case is adding icons or extra info dynamically, such as external link arrows or quotation marks for blockquotes."

---

## **02. 🌟CSS Positioning: `relative` vs `absolute`**

### 📌 **Question**

Explain the difference between these CSS position values:

- `position: absolute;`
    
- `position: relative;`
    

---

### 🔍 **Points to Cover**

- How each positioning type works
    
- How elements are placed relative to their parent or the document
    
- Code examples to demonstrate the difference
    
- When to use `absolute` vs `relative` in real-world layouts
    

---

### ✅ **What the Interviewer is Testing**

They want to check your understanding of:

- How **CSS positioning context** works
    
- The difference between **normal flow**, offsets (`top`, `left`, etc.), and containing blocks
    
- Practical use cases for each positioning type
    

---

### 💡 **How to Answer in the Interview**

#### 🔹 **What Each Position Value Does**

### ✅ `position: relative;`

- The element **remains in the normal document flow**.
    
- You can **nudge it using `top`, `left`, `right`, or `bottom`**.
    
- The **space it occupies does not change** – it just moves visually.
    

---

### ✅ `position: absolute;`

- The element is **removed from the normal flow**.
    
- It is positioned **relative to the nearest ancestor that has `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, or `sticky` positioning**.
    
- If no such ancestor exists, it is positioned **relative to the document (html/body)**.
    

---

### 🔹 **Example Demonstration**

**HTML:**

```html
<div class="parent">
  Parent
  <div class="child">Child</div>
</div>
```

**CSS:**

```css
.parent {
  position: relative; 
  width: 200px; 
  height: 200px; 
  background: lightblue;
}

.child {
  position: absolute;
  top: 20px; 
  left: 30px; 
  background: coral;
}
```

📌 Here, `.child` will be **20px from the top and 30px from the left of `.parent`**, because `.parent` is **positioned relative**.

---

### 🔹 **Key Differences**

|Feature|`relative`|`absolute`|
|---|---|---|
|**Normal Flow**|✅ Stays in normal flow|❌ Removed from normal flow|
|**Reference Point**|Its own original position|Nearest positioned ancestor or document root|
|**Space Occupied**|Keeps its original space|Does **not** occupy space|

---

### 🔹 **When to Use Them**

✅ **Use `relative`**

- To **nudge an element slightly** while keeping its layout intact.
    
- To **create a positioning context** for absolutely positioned children.
    

✅ **Use `absolute`**

- For elements like **dropdowns, tooltips, badges, icons** that need precise placement.
    
- When you **don’t want the element to affect the layout flow**.
    

---

### 🎯 **Sample Interview Answer**

> "`relative` keeps an element in the normal layout flow but allows visual shifting using offsets.  
> `absolute` removes the element from flow and positions it relative to the nearest positioned ancestor.
> 
> For example, I often set a parent container to `relative` and a child element to `absolute` to place dropdowns or notification badges precisely without disturbing other elements on the page."

---

### ✅ **What the Interviewer is Testing**

They want to know if you:

- Understand **multiple centering techniques**
    
- Are familiar with **modern layout systems** (Flexbox, Grid)
    
- Know **legacy/older techniques** like `absolute + transform` or `margin: auto`
    

---

### 💡 **How to Answer**

Start with:

> “There are several ways to center a `<div>`, and the best approach depends on the layout system and browser support.”

Then briefly explain **each method with a code snippet.**

---

### 🔹 **1. Using Flexbox**

```css
.parent {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center; /* Horizontal */
  align-items: center;     /* Vertical */
  height: 300px;           /* Needed for vertical centering */
}
```

✅ **Pros:** Modern, responsive, works for both axes  
✅ **Best for:** Buttons, cards, modals inside containers

---

### 🔹 **2. Using CSS Grid**

```css
.parent {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center; /* Centers horizontally & vertically */
  height: 300px;
}
```

✅ **Pros:** Short syntax, clean solution  
✅ **Best for:** Grid-based layouts or simple centering

---

### 🔹 **3. Using Absolute Positioning + Transform**

```css
.parent {
  position: relative;
  height: 300px;
}

.child {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

✅ **Pros:** Works without Flexbox/Grid  
❌ **Cons:** Requires explicit positioning and extra code

---

### 🔹 **4. Using `margin: auto` (Horizontal Only)**

```css
.child {
  width: 200px;
  margin: 0 auto; /* Centers horizontally */
}
```

✅ **Pros:** Very simple  
❌ **Cons:** Only works horizontally and needs a fixed width

---

### 🎯 **Sample Interview Answer**

> “There are multiple ways to center a `<div>`:
> 
> - With **Flexbox**, we use `display: flex`, `justify-content: center`, and `align-items: center`.
>     
> - With **CSS Grid**, `display: grid` and `place-items: center` achieves the same in one line.
>     
> - We can also use **absolute positioning** with `top: 50%; left: 50%; transform: translate(-50%, -50%)`.
>     
> - For simple horizontal centering, `margin: 0 auto` works if the element has a fixed width.
>     
> 
> In modern layouts, Flexbox or Grid is preferred because they are cleaner, responsive, and require less code.”

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 480px) {
  .container {
    padding: 10px;
    flex-direction: column;
  }
}
```

✅ **Pros:** Gives fine control for specific breakpoints  
❌ **Cons:** Hard to maintain if too many breakpoints are used

---

### 🎯 **Sample Interview Answer**

> “Media queries let us apply CSS rules based on device properties like width or orientation.
> 
> For example, I can write:
> 
> ```css
> @media (max-width: 600px) {
>   body { font-size: 14px; background: lightblue; }
> }
> ```
> 
> This applies styles only when the screen width is **600px or smaller**, which is common for mobile.
> 
> In modern responsive design, we pick breakpoints based on the layout rather than specific devices.”

> 
> ```css
> .btn { transition: background-color 0.3s ease; }  
> .btn:hover { background-color: darkblue; }
> ```
> 
> - With **`keyframes`**, we can define multiple steps, e.g.:
>     
> 
> ```css
> @keyframes bounce { 0%{scale:1;} 50%{scale:1.2;} 100%{scale:1;} }
> ```
> 
> For most hover effects, `transition` is preferred because it’s simpler and more performant, while `keyframes` is used for advanced effects.”

## **02. Purpose of the `<!DOCTYPE>` Declaration**

### 📌 **Question**

What is the purpose of the `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration in HTML?

---

### 🔍 **Approaches to Cover**

- What `<!DOCTYPE>` is
    
- Why it is used
    
- Difference between HTML and HTML5 doctype
    

---

### ✅ **What the Interviewer is Testing**

They want to know if you:

- Understand the **role of `<!DOCTYPE>` in browsers**
    
- Know the difference between **quirks mode** and **standards mode**
    
- Are aware of **HTML5’s simplified syntax**
    

---

### 💡 **How to Answer**

Start with:

> “The `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration tells the browser which version of HTML the page is written in and ensures it renders the page in **standards-compliant mode**.”

---

### 🔹 **Key Points**

1. **Defines Document Type** – It specifies the HTML version being used.
    
2. **Triggers Standards Mode** – Without it, browsers may render in _quirks mode_ (old, non-standard behavior).
    
3. **HTML5 Simplified Doctype** –
    
    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    ```
    
    – This single line works for all modern browsers.
    
4. **Older HTML/XHTML Versions** – Used longer, more complex doctypes.
    

---

### 🎯 **Sample Interview Answer**

> “The `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration tells the browser which version of HTML to expect. It ensures the browser uses **standards mode** instead of **quirks mode**, which can break layouts.
> 
> In HTML5, the doctype is simplified to just `<!DOCTYPE html>`, unlike older versions that had long declarations.
> 
> Without it, browsers might fall back to older rendering rules, leading to inconsistent behavior across browsers.”

```html
<!DOCTYPE html> <!-- Defines document type and version (HTML5) -->

<html lang="en"> <!-- Root element -->

<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">              <!-- Character encoding -->
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> <!-- Mobile responsiveness -->
  <title>Page Title</title>           <!-- Title shown in browser tab -->
</head>

<body>
  <h1>Hello World!</h1>               <!-- Visible page content -->
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>

</html>
```

---

### 📌 **Question**

What are the **types of CSS**? Explain **inline, internal, and external CSS** with examples.

---

### 🔍 **Approaches to Cover**

- Definition of the three types of CSS
    
- How they are written and applied
    
- Advantages and disadvantages of each
    
- When to use which type
    

---

### ✅ **What the Interviewer is Testing**

They want to see if you:

- Know **different ways to add CSS to a webpage**
    
- Understand the **pros/cons of each method**
    
- Can explain **best practices for maintainable styling**
    

---

### 💡 **How to Answer**

Start with:

> “CSS can be applied to HTML in three ways – **inline, internal, and external CSS**. They differ in how the styles are written and maintained.”

---

### 🔹 **Key Differences**

|**Type**|**Where Defined?**|**Example**|**Advantages**|**Disadvantages**|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Inline CSS**|Inside the HTML tag (using `style` attribute)|`<p style="color:red;">Text</p>`|Quick styling for single elements|Hard to maintain, mixes style with content|
|**Internal CSS**|Inside `<style>` in `<head>`|`<style>p { color: red; }</style>`|Good for single-page styles|Not reusable across pages|
|**External CSS**|In a separate `.css` file linked via `<link>`|`<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">`|Best for maintainability, reusable|Requires extra HTTP request|

---

### 🔹 **Examples**

#### ✅ **Inline CSS**

```html
<p style="color: blue; font-size: 18px;">Hello World!</p>
```

#### ✅ **Internal CSS**

```html
<head>
  <style>
    p { color: blue; font-size: 18px; }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <p>Hello World!</p>
</body>
```

#### ✅ **External CSS**

```html
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
<body>
  <p>Hello World!</p>
</body>
```

📄 **styles.css**

```css
p {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 18px;

>     
> - **Internal CSS** – Written inside `<style>` in the `<head>`. Useful for single-page projects.
>     
> - **External CSS** – Written in a `.css` file and linked via `<link>`. Best for large projects as it keeps structure and style separate.
>     
> 
> For example:
> 
> ```html
> <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
> ```
> 
> links an external CSS file.
> 
> **Best practice:** Use external CSS for maintainability and reusability.”

## **02. 🌟Explain the CSS Box Model**

### 📌 **Question**

Explain the **CSS Box Model**.

---

### 🔍 **Approaches to Cover**

- What the box model is
    
- Different parts of the box model (content, padding, border, margin)
    
- How it affects layout and element size
    
- Role of `box-sizing` property
    

---

### ✅ **What the Interviewer is Testing**

They want to see if you:

- Understand how **elements are rendered in the browser**
    
- Know the difference between **content, padding, border, and margin**
    
- Can explain how **total element size is calculated**
    

---

### 💡 **How to Answer**

Start with:

> “The CSS Box Model describes how every HTML element is treated as a rectangular box, consisting of **content, padding, border, and margin**.”

---

### 🔹 **Structure of the Box Model**

```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│           Margin            │
│  ┌───────────────────────┐  │
│  │        Border         │  │
│  │  ┌─────────────────┐  │  │
│  │  │     Padding     │  │  │
│  │  │ ┌─────────────┐ │  │  │
│  │  │ │  Content    │ │  │  │
│  │  │ └─────────────┘ │  │  │
│  │  └─────────────────┘  │  │
│  └───────────────────────┘  │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

---

### 🔹 **Parts of the Box Model**

|**Part**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**Content**|The actual text, image, or content of the element.|
|**Padding**|Space **inside the element**, between content and border.|
|**Border**|Surrounds the padding and content.|
|**Margin**|Space **outside the element**, separating it from other elements.|

---

### 🔹 **Size Calculation**

**Total Element Width = content + padding + border + margin**  
**Total Element Height = content + padding + border + margin**

Using `box-sizing: border-box;` makes **padding and border included in the width/height.**

---

### 🔹 **Example**

```html
<div style="
  width: 200px;
  padding: 20px;
  border: 5px solid black;
  margin: 10px;">
  Box Model Example
</div>
```

---

### 🎯 **Sample Interview Answer**

> “The CSS Box Model explains how every HTML element is a box with **content, padding, border, and margin**.
> 
> For example, if an element has `width: 200px`, `padding: 20px`, and `border: 5px`, its **actual width becomes 250px** (excluding margin).
> 
> Using `box-sizing: border-box` ensures padding and border are included inside the specified width/height, making layouts easier to manage.”

---

## **03. 🌟Explain CSS Specificity and How Styles Are Applied**

### 📌 **Question**

Explain **CSS specificity** and how styles are applied when multiple rules target the same element.

---

### 🔍 **Approaches to Cover**

- What CSS specificity is
    
- How browsers decide which style to apply
    
- The specificity hierarchy (inline → id → class → element)
    
- Importance of cascade and `!important`
    

---

### ✅ **What the Interviewer is Testing**

They want to see if you:

- Understand **how CSS resolves conflicts**
    
- Know the **specificity calculation rules**
    
- Can explain **best practices for writing predictable CSS**
    

---

### 💡 **How to Answer**

Start with:

> “CSS specificity determines **which rule takes precedence** when multiple rules apply to the same element.”

---

### 🔹 **Specificity Hierarchy (High → Low)**

|**Selector Type**|**Specificity Value**|
|---|---|
|Inline Styles|**1000**|
|ID Selector (`#id`)|**100**|
|Class, Attribute, Pseudo-class (`.class`, `[attr]`, `:hover`)|**10**|
|Element & Pseudo-element (`div`, `p`, `::before`)|**1**|
|Universal (`*`)|**0**|

✅ If two rules have the same specificity, **the last one in the CSS file wins** (cascade).

---

### 🔹 **Example**

```html
<p id="para" class="text">Hello</p>
```

```css
p { color: blue; }              /* Specificity = 1 */
.text { color: green; }         /* Specificity = 10 */
#para { color: red; }           /* Specificity = 100 */
<p style="color: purple;">      /* Inline = 1000 */
```

👉 Final color = **purple** (inline style wins).

---

### 🔹 **Key Points**

1. Inline styles have the **highest priority**.
    
2. ID selectors have more weight than class selectors.
    
3. Use `!important` sparingly – it **overrides all rules**, but makes CSS harder to maintain.
    

---

### 🎯 **Sample Interview Answer**

> “CSS specificity decides which styles are applied when multiple rules match an element.
> 
> The order of priority is: **inline styles > IDs > classes/attributes/pseudo-classes > element selectors.**
> 
> For example:
> 
> ```css
> p { color: blue; }   /* 1 */
> .text { color: green; } /* 10 */
> #para { color: red; }  /* 100 */
> ```
> 
> The paragraph will be red because `#para` has higher specificity.
> 
> If two rules have the same specificity, the last one in the CSS file is applied.”

- Know the **syntax differences (`:` vs `::`)**
    
- Can give practical examples
    

---

### 💡 **How to Answer**

Start with:

> “Pseudo-classes define a **special state of an element**, while pseudo-elements are used to **style specific parts of an element’s content**.”

---

### 🔹 **Key Differences**

|**Aspect**|**Pseudo-Class**|**Pseudo-Element**|
|---|---|---|
|**Purpose**|Styles an element **based on state**|Styles **a part of an element**|
|**Syntax**|Uses a **single colon (`:`)**|Uses **double colon (`::`)**|
|**Examples**|`:hover`, `:focus`, `:nth-child()`|`::before`, `::after`, `::first-line`|
|**Affects**|Whole element|A part of element’s content|

---

### 🔹 **Examples**

#### ✅ **Pseudo-Class**

```css
button:hover {
  background-color: blue;
}
```

👉 Styles the **button when hovered**.

#### ✅ **Pseudo-Element**

```css
p::first-line {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

👉 Styles **only the first line** of a paragraph.

---

### 🎯 **Sample Interview Answer**

> “Pseudo-classes define a special **state of an element**, such as `:hover`, `:focus`, or `:nth-child()`.
> 
> Pseudo-elements style **specific parts of an element’s content**, like `::before`, `::after`, or `::first-letter`.
> 
> For example:
> 
> ```css
> a:hover { color: red; }    /* Pseudo-class */
> p::first-letter { font-size: 30px; }  /* Pseudo-element */
> ```
> 
> The main difference is **pseudo-classes affect the whole element in a specific state**, whereas **pseudo-elements affect part of the content.**”

- Know **impact on layout and interactivity**
    
- Can explain **real-world use cases**
    

---

### 💡 **How to Answer**

Start with:

> “Both `display: none` and `visibility: hidden` hide elements, but **they behave differently in terms of layout and accessibility**.”

---

### 🔹 **Key Differences**

|**Aspect**|**display: none**|**visibility: hidden**|
|---|---|---|
|**Visibility**|Element is hidden|Element is hidden|
|**Space Occupied?**|❌ No space is reserved|✅ Space is still reserved|
|**Affects Layout?**|Yes – other elements move up|No – layout stays intact|
|**Accessibility**|Element is **not accessible**|Still **accessible to screen readers**|
|**Use Case**|Completely remove element visually and from layout|Temporarily hide but keep layout intact|

---

### 🔹 **Examples**

```css
/* Removes the element from layout */
.hidden1 {
  display: none;
}

/* Hides the element but keeps space */
.hidden2 {
  visibility: hidden;
}
```

```html
<p class="hidden1">This will not take space</p>
<p class="hidden2">This will take space but stay invisible</p>
```

---

### 🎯 **Sample Interview Answer**

> “`display: none` **completely removes an element from the layout**, so it doesn’t take up any space, while `visibility: hidden` **makes the element invisible but still reserves space for it**.
> 
> For example, if you want a dropdown menu to collapse entirely, you use `display: none`, but if you want an element to stay in place but invisible (like temporarily hiding a label), you use `visibility: hidden`.”

- Know **specificity differences** (`id` has higher weight)
    
- Can explain **when to use each in real projects**
    

---

### 💡 **How to Answer**

Start with:

> “Both `id` and `class` selectors are used to style elements in CSS, but `id` is meant for **unique elements**, while `class` is for **reusable styling across multiple elements**.”

---

### 🔹 **Key Differences**

|**Aspect**|**ID Selector**|**Class Selector**|
|---|---|---|
|**Syntax**|`#idName { ... }`|`.className { ... }`|
|**Uniqueness**|Must be **unique** per page|Can be **used on multiple elements**|
|**Specificity**|Higher (100)|Lower (10)|
|**Usage**|For a single, unique element|For groups of elements|
|**JS Access**|`getElementById("id")`|`getElementsByClassName("class")`|

---

### 🔹 **Example**

```html
<!-- Using id -->
<h1 id="main-title">Welcome!</h1>

<!-- Using class -->
<p class="intro">This is the first paragraph.</p>
<p class="intro">This is the second paragraph.</p>
```

```css
#main-title {
  color: blue;
}

.intro {
  font-size: 18px;
  color: gray;
}
```

---

### 🎯 **Sample Interview Answer**

> “The `id` selector is used to style a **single unique element**, while the `class` selector is used for **multiple elements with the same style**.
> 
> For example:
> 
> ```css
> #header { color: red; }   /* ID selector */
> .intro { color: blue; }   /* Class selector */
> ```
> 
> IDs have **higher specificity** than classes, so if both target the same element, the `id` style will apply.
> 
> Best practice is to use IDs for unique elements like headers or forms, and classes for reusable styles.”

### 💡 **How to Answer**

Start with:

> “There are several ways to center elements in CSS – using **Flexbox**, **Grid**, **absolute positioning with transform**, or **margin auto** for horizontal centering.”

---

### 🔹 **Methods to Center Elements**

|**Method**|**How It Works**|**Example**|
|---|---|---|
|**Flexbox**|Use `display: flex`, `justify-content`, and `align-items`.|Centers both horizontally & vertically|
|**Grid**|Use `display: grid` with `place-items: center`.|Simple and concise|
|**Absolute + Transform**|Position element absolutely and shift using `transform: translate()`.|Works for fixed-size containers|
|**Margin Auto**|Use `margin: auto` (for block elements with fixed width).|Only centers horizontally|

---

### 🔹 **Examples**

#### ✅ **Flexbox**

```css
.parent {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center; /* Horizontal */
  align-items: center;     /* Vertical */
  height: 300px;
}
```

#### ✅ **Grid**

```css
.parent {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center; /* Both horizontally and vertically */
  height: 300px;
}
```

#### ✅ **Absolute + Transform**

```css
.child {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

- Know when `z-index` works and when it doesn’t
    
- Can explain **real-world usage scenarios**
    

---

### 💡 **How to Answer**

Start with:

> “The `z-index` property in CSS controls the **stacking order of elements** along the z-axis (which element appears in front or behind).”

---

### 🔹 **Key Points**

1. **Higher z-index = element appears on top.**
    
2. Works **only on positioned elements** (`relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, `sticky`).
    
3. Default value = `auto` (stacking depends on HTML order).
    

---

### 🔹 **Example**

```html
<div style="position: relative; z-index: 1; background: red;">Box 1</div>
<div style="position: relative; z-index: 2; background: blue;">Box 2</div>
```

👉 Here, **Box 2 will appear on top of Box 1** because it has a higher `z-index`.

---

### 🔹 **Common Use Cases**

|**Scenario**|**Why z-index is Used**|
|---|---|
|Modals & Popups|Bring modal above page content|
|Dropdown Menus|Show menus above other elements|
|Tooltips|Display tooltips above text/images|
|Layered UI Elements|Stack banners, ads, floating buttons|

---

### 🎯 **Sample Interview Answer**

> “The `z-index` property determines which element appears **on top when elements overlap**.
> 
> It works **only on elements with a position value other than static**.
> 
> For example:
> 
> ```css
> .popup { position: absolute; z-index: 9999; }
> ```
> 
> ensures the popup stays above other elements.
> 
> The higher the `z-index`, the closer the element is to the viewer.”

---

### 🔹 **Key Differences Table**

|**Position**|**Behavior**|
|---|---|
|**relative**|Positioned relative to its normal position. Other elements are **not affected**.|
|**absolute**|Positioned **relative to the nearest positioned ancestor** (not viewport). Removed from normal flow.|
|**fixed**|Positioned relative to **viewport** and does not move on scroll.|
|**sticky**|Acts as **relative** until a scroll threshold, then becomes **fixed**.|

---

### 🔹 **Examples**

#### ✅ **Relative**

```css
.box {
  position: relative;
  top: 20px; /* Moves down 20px but still takes original space */
}
```

#### ✅ **Absolute**

```css
.box {
  position: absolute;
  top: 20px;
  left: 30px; /* Positioned relative to nearest positioned ancestor */
}
```

#### ✅ **Fixed**

```css

  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  width: 100%;
} /* Stays at top even when scrolling */
```

#### ✅ **Sticky**

```css
.header {
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
} /* Behaves like relative until scrolled to top, then sticks */
```

---

### 🎯 **Sample Interview Answer**

> “The `position` property controls element placement.
> 
> - **Relative** – moves relative to its normal position but still occupies space.
>

- Understand **how browsers decide which CSS rules apply**
    
- Know **the difference between cascade and inheritance**
    
- Can explain **specificity, order, and `!important`**
    

---

### 💡 **How to Answer**

Start with:

> “CSS follows a **cascade** to decide which rule applies when multiple rules target the same element. It considers **importance, specificity, and source order**.”

---

### 🔹 **Cascade Rule Priority**

1️⃣ **Inline styles** (`style="..."`) – Highest  
2️⃣ **IDs (`#id`)**  
3️⃣ **Classes, attributes, pseudo-classes (`.class`, `[attr]`, `:hover`)**  
4️⃣ **Elements and pseudo-elements (`p`, `::before`)**  
5️⃣ **Browser default styles**

✅ If two rules have the same specificity, **the later one in the CSS file wins.**

---

### 🔹 **Inheritance**

- Some properties (like `color`, `font-family`) **inherit by default**.
    
- Others (like `margin`, `padding`, `border`) **do not inherit**.
    
- Use `inherit`, `initial`, or `unset` to control inheritance.
    

---

### 🔹 **Example**

```html
<p id="para" class="text">Hello</p>
```

```css
p { color: blue; }          /* specificity = 1 */
.text { color: green; }     /* specificity = 10 */
#para { color: red; }       /* specificity = 100 */
```

👉 Final color = **red** (highest specificity).

---

### 🎯 **Sample Interview Answer**

> “CSS applies rules based on **cascade**, which considers **importance (`!important`), specificity, and source order**.
> 
> If multiple rules target the same element, the **highest specificity wins**, and if specificity is equal, the **last rule in the file wins**.
> 
> Some properties like `color` and `font-size` **inherit automatically**, while layout properties like `margin` or `padding` do not.
> 
> Example:
> 
> ```css
> p { color: blue; }  
> .text { color: green; }  
> #para { color: red; }  
> ```
> 
> The paragraph appears **red** because `#para` has the highest specificity.”

3. **When to Use:**
    
    - On elements that will **frequently animate or change** (e.g., hover effects, sliders).
        
4. **Warning:** Overusing it can **consume more memory** and reduce performance.
    

---

### 🔹 **Example**

```css
.card {
  will-change: transform, opacity;
  transition: transform 0.3s ease, opacity 0.3s ease;
}
```

👉 The browser pre-optimizes `transform` and `opacity` changes for smooth animations.

## **06. Difference Between Units – `em` vs `rem` vs `%` vs `px`**

### 📌 **Question**

What is the difference between **`em`**, **`rem`**, **`%`**, and **`px`** units in CSS?

---

### 🔍 **Approaches to Cover**

- What each unit means
    
- How they behave relative to parent or root elements
    
- When to use each unit
    
- Example comparisons
    

---

### ✅ **What the Interviewer is Testing**

They want to see if you:

- Understand the difference between **absolute and relative units**
    
- Know **how `em`, `rem`, and `%` scale with font size or container size**
    
- Can provide **practical use cases for each unit**
    

---

### 💡 **How to Answer**

Start with:

> “In CSS, `px` is an absolute unit, while `em`, `rem`, and `%` are relative units that scale based on parent or root font sizes.”

---

### 🔹 **Key Differences**

|**Unit**|**Type**|**Relative To**|**Example Behavior**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**px**|Absolute|Fixed size (not scalable)|`font-size: 16px` → Always 16px|
|**em**|Relative|Parent element’s font size|`2em` = 2 × parent font size|
|**rem**|Relative|Root (`html`) font size|`2rem` = 2 × root font size|
|**%**|Relative|Parent element’s size (width, height, etc.)|`50%` = half of parent’s size|

---

### 🔹 **Example**

```css
html { font-size: 16px; }

div { font-size: 1.5em; }  /* 24px if parent is 16px */
p   { font-size: 1.5rem; } /* 24px regardless of parent */
.box { width: 50%; }       /* 50% of parent width */
```

---

### 🎯 **Sample Interview Answer**

> “In CSS, `px` is a fixed unit, while `em`, `rem`, and `%` are relative:
> 
> - **`em`** → relative to the **parent font size**
>     
> - **`rem`** → relative to the **root font size**
>     
> - **`%`** → relative to the **parent element’s size**
>     
> 
> For example, if the root font size is `16px`, then `2rem` = `32px`, but `2em` depends on the parent element’s size.
> 
> Relative units make designs **more scalable and responsive**, while `px` gives fixed sizing.”
