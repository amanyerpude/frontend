Perfect. We’ll do this properly.

We are now simulating:

- ✅ React 18
    
- ✅ TypeScript
    
- ✅ Functional components
    
- ✅ Controlled component pattern
    
- ✅ Interview-optimized structure
    
- ✅ Step-by-step
    
- ✅ No overengineering
    
- ✅ Pause after each step

# ✅ Step 1 (React + TypeScript) — Minimal Static Component

We always start simple.

No state.  
No props.  
No interaction.  
Just structure.

---

## 🎤 What You Say to the Interviewer

> “I’ll first create a minimal `Rating` component with static SVG stars.  
> I want to establish the structure before introducing props or state.”

That shows structured thinking.

---

## 🧠 What You're Thinking Internally

- Don’t jump into state yet.
    
- Keep it simple.
    
- Use inline SVG.
    
- Make it reusable.
    
- Avoid premature typing complexity.

## 📄 components/Rating.tsx

```tsx
import React from "react";

const Rating: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <div className="rating-container">
      {Array.from({ length: 5 }).map((_, index) => (
        <button key={index} className="rating-item">

  );
};

export default Rating;
```

## 📄 App.tsx

```tsx
import React from "react";
import Rating from "./components/Rating";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Rate this product</h2>
      <Rating />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

---

## 🎤 What You Say After Writing It

> “Right now this is a static implementation.  
> I’m using inline SVG so that I can dynamically control the fill color later.  
> Next, I’ll introduce proper typing and convert this into a controlled component.”

That last line signals forward planning.

---

## 🔎 What Interviewer Is Evaluating

- Did you overcomplicate?
    
- Did you use proper structure?
    
- Did you avoid premature state?
    
- Is your TypeScript clean?
    
- Are you thinking incrementally?
    

---

## 🧠 Why This Is Strong

You:

- Started minimal
    
- Used SVG correctly
    
- Used proper folder structure
    
- Avoided class components
    
- Kept it interview-realistic
    

---

## ⏸ Pause Here

Next logical step:

👉 Define typed props  
👉 Convert to configurable star count  
👉 Prepare controlled API

Say:

**Next Step (React + TS)**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ✅ Step 2 (React + TypeScript) — Define Typed Props & Make It Controlled

Now we move from static → proper component API.

This is where TypeScript matters.

---

# 🎯 Goal of This Step

1. Define a proper prop interface
    
2. Make component controlled
    
3. Make star count configurable
    
4. Remove hardcoded `5`
    
5. No hover yet
    

---

## 🎤 What You Say to the Interviewer

> "I’ll now define a proper prop interface and make this a controlled component.  
> The parent will pass `value` and `onChange`, and optionally `totalItems`."

This signals strong React fundamentals.

---

## 🧠 What You're Thinking Internally

We need:

```
interface RatingProps {
  value: number
  onChange: (value: number) => void
  totalItems?: number
}
```

Rules:

- value → controlled selected rating
    
- onChange → callback
    
- totalItems → optional (default = 5)
    

No internal selected state yet.

---

# 💻 Updated Code

---

## 📄 components/Rating.tsx

```tsx
import React from "react";

interface RatingProps {
  value: number;
  onChange: (value: number) => void;
  totalItems?: number;
}

const Rating: React.FC<RatingProps> = ({
  value,
  onChange,
  totalItems = 5,
}) => {
  return (
    <div className="rating-container">
      {Array.from({ length: totalItems }).map((_, index) => {
        const isActive = index <= value;

        return (
          <button
            key={index}
            className="rating-item"
            onClick={() => onChange(index)}
          >
            <svg
              viewBox="0 0 24 24"
              width="32"
              height="32"
              fill={isActive ? "gold" : "lightgray"}
            >
              <path d="M12 2l2.9 6.6 7.1.6-5.4 4.6 1.6 7-6.2-3.7-6.2 3.7 1.6-7L2 9.2l7.1-.6L12 2z" />
            </svg>
          </button>
        );
      })}
    </div>
  );
};

export default Rating;
```

---

## 📄 App.tsx (Now Controls State)

```tsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import Rating from "./components/Rating";

function App() {
  const [rating, setRating] = useState<number>(-1);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Rate this product</h2>
      <Rating value={rating} onChange={setRating} totalItems={5} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

---

## 🎤 What You Say After Writing It

> "Now the component is fully controlled.  
> It doesn’t manage its own selected state — the parent owns it.  
> This makes the component predictable and reusable in forms or larger applications."

Strong explanation.

---

# 🔎 What Interviewer Is Evaluating

- Proper TypeScript interface
    
- Correct default prop handling
    
- Correct controlled pattern
    
- No unnecessary internal state
    
- Clean separation of concerns
    

---

# 🧠 What You Just Demonstrated

You showed:

```
Component = pure UI
Parent = state owner
```

That’s textbook React architecture.

---

# ⚠️ Important Detail

We used:

```
index <= value
```

This means:

- If value = -1 → none selected
    
- If value = 2 → 3 stars selected
    

That’s intentional.

---

# ⏸ Pause Here

Next logical step:

👉 Add hover preview (temporary state inside component)  
👉 Introduce internal hover state (even in controlled component)  
👉 Manage priority between hover & value

This is where real complexity starts.

Say:

**Next Step (React + TS)**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ✅ Step 3 (React + TypeScript) — Add Hover Preview State

Now we move into real component logic.

We remain controlled for `value`,  
but we introduce **temporary internal hover state**.

This is correct architecture.

---

# 🎯 Goal of This Step

1. Add `hoverIndex` (internal state)
    
2. Prioritize hover over selected value
    
3. Do NOT mutate parent state on hover
    
4. Keep component controlled
    

---

## 🎤 What You Say to the Interviewer

> "Even though this is a controlled component, hover is a temporary UI state.  
> So I’ll manage `hoverIndex` internally while keeping the selected value controlled by the parent."

That’s a strong architectural explanation.

---

## 🧠 What You're Thinking Internally

We now have:

```
value → controlled (parent)
hoverIndex → internal (component only)
```

Display logic:

```
displayIndex = hoverIndex ?? value
```

Hover overrides visually, not logically.

---

# 💻 Updated Rating.tsx

---

## 📄 components/Rating.tsx

```tsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

interface RatingProps {
  value: number;
  onChange: (value: number) => void;
  totalItems?: number;
}

const Rating: React.FC<RatingProps> = ({
  value,
  onChange,
  totalItems = 5,
}) => {
  const [hoverIndex, setHoverIndex] = useState<number | null>(null);

  return (
    <div className="rating-container">
      {Array.from({ length: totalItems }).map((_, index) => {
        const displayIndex =
          hoverIndex !== null ? hoverIndex : value;

        const isActive = index <= displayIndex;

        return (
          <button
            key={index}
            className="rating-item"
            onClick={() => onChange(index)}
            onMouseEnter={() => setHoverIndex(index)}
            onMouseLeave={() => setHoverIndex(null)}
          >
            <svg
              viewBox="0 0 24 24"
              width="32"
              height="32"
              fill={isActive ? "gold" : "lightgray"}
            >
              <path d="M12 2l2.9 6.6 7.1.6-5.4 4.6 1.6 7-6.2-3.7-6.2 3.7 1.6-7L2 9.2l7.1-.6L12 2z" />
            </svg>
          </button>
        );
      })}
    </div>
  );
};

export default Rating;
```

---

## 🎤 What You Say After Writing It

> "I introduced an internal `hoverIndex` state.  
> During rendering, hover takes priority over the controlled value.  
> This allows preview behavior without mutating the parent’s state."

That explanation shows deep clarity.

---

# 🔎 What Interviewer Is Evaluating

- Did you keep controlled pattern intact?
    
- Did you separate persistent vs temporary state?
    
- Is TypeScript properly typed?
    
- Did you avoid state confusion?
    
- Is logic readable?
    

---

# 🧠 What You Just Demonstrated

You showed layered state thinking:

```
Persistent state → Parent
Temporary state → Component
Display state → Derived
```

That’s mature React design.

---

# ⚠️ Current Limitation

Right now:

If:

```
value = 2
hoverIndex = 4
```

All 5 stars become gold.

We are NOT differentiating saved vs preview yet.

That’s the next bar-raiser.

---

# ⏸ Pause Here

Next logical step:

👉 Differentiate locked vs preview visually  
👉 Improve UX layering  
👉 Refactor logic cleanly

Say:

**Next Step (React + TS)**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ✅ Step 4 (React + TypeScript) — Differentiate Locked vs Hover Preview

Now we enter **mid → senior territory**.

Currently:

If

```
value = 2
hoverIndex = 4
```

All 5 stars turn gold.

That hides the fact that only 3 are saved.

We’ll fix that.

---

# 🎯 Goal of This Step

1. Visually distinguish:
    
    - Saved rating (locked)
        
    - Hover preview (temporary)
        
2. Keep architecture clean
    
3. Avoid messy inline conditionals
    

---

## 🎤 What You Say to the Interviewer

> "Right now hover overrides the selected value visually.  
> In a production UI, it’s better to distinguish between the saved rating and the preview state.  
> I’ll update the rendering logic to layer these states."

That signals UX maturity.

---

## 🧠 What You're Thinking Internally

We want this behavior:

If:

```
value = 2  → 3 locked
hoverIndex = 4
```

Visually:

```
0 1 2 → gold (locked)
3 4   → blue (preview)
```

Logic:

```
IF hover exists:
    IF index <= value → gold
    ELSE IF index <= hoverIndex → blue
    ELSE → gray
ELSE:
    IF index <= value → gold
    ELSE → gray
```

---

# 💻 Updated Rating.tsx

We’ll extract a helper function for clarity.

---

## 📄 Updated Component

```tsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

interface RatingProps {
  value: number;
  onChange: (value: number) => void;
  totalItems?: number;
}

const Rating: React.FC<RatingProps> = ({
  value,
  onChange,
  totalItems = 5,
}) => {
  const [hoverIndex, setHoverIndex] = useState<number | null>(null);

  const getFillColor = (index: number): string => {
    if (hoverIndex !== null) {
      if (index <= value) return "gold"; // locked
      if (index <= hoverIndex) return "dodgerblue"; // preview
      return "lightgray";
    }

    return index <= value ? "gold" : "lightgray";
  };

  return (
    <div className="rating-container">
      {Array.from({ length: totalItems }).map((_, index) => (
        <button
          key={index}
          className="rating-item"
          onClick={() => onChange(index)}
          onMouseEnter={() => setHoverIndex(index)}
          onMouseLeave={() => setHoverIndex(null)}
        >
          <svg
            viewBox="0 0 24 24"
            width="32"
            height="32"
            fill={getFillColor(index)}
          >
            <path d="M12 2l2.9 6.6 7.1.6-5.4 4.6 1.6 7-6.2-3.7-6.2 3.7 1.6-7L2 9.2l7.1-.6L12 2z" />
          </svg>
        </button>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};

export default Rating;
```

---

## 🎤 What You Say After Writing It

> "I extracted the color logic into a helper function to keep the JSX clean.  
> Now the saved rating and hover preview are visually distinct, improving clarity."

That shows code hygiene and UX thinking.

---

# 🔎 What Interviewer Is Evaluating

- Did you think beyond minimal implementation?
    
- Did you separate logic from JSX?
    
- Is TypeScript typing clean?
    
- Did you handle overlapping states correctly?
    
- Are conditions readable?
    

---

# 🧠 What You Just Demonstrated

You moved from:

Basic functionality  
→ UX-aware layered state design

That’s a noticeable skill jump.

---

# ⚠️ Architecture Note

We still:

- Haven’t introduced async
    
- Haven’t optimized re-renders
    
- Haven’t memoized
    
- Haven’t added accessibility
    

Good. We’re pacing correctly.

---

# ⏸ Pause Here

Next major leap:

👉 Optimistic update (async simulation)  
👉 Loading state  
👉 Rollback on failure  
👉 Prevent race conditions

This shifts from UI → product engineering.

Say:

**Next Step (React + TS)**

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ✅ Step 5 (React + TypeScript) — Optimistic Update + Rollback

Now we move from UI logic → real product engineering.

This is where interview difficulty increases.

---

# 🎯 Goal of This Step

1. Simulate backend save
    
2. Update UI immediately (optimistic update)
    
3. Show loading indicator
    
4. Roll back on failure
    
5. Prevent race conditions
    

---

# ⚠️ Architectural Decision

Since this is a **controlled component**,  
the optimistic logic should live in the **parent**.

That’s important.

---

## 🎤 What You Say to the Interviewer

> "Since the component is controlled, optimistic updates should be handled in the parent.  
> The `Rating` component will remain a pure UI component, while the parent simulates the async save and handles rollback."

That is a very strong architectural answer.

---

## 🧠 What You're Thinking Internally

We now manage in `App.tsx`:

```
rating
loading
previousRating
```

Flow:

```
1. Store previous rating
2. Update rating immediately
3. Set loading = true
4. Simulate API
5. On success → stop loading
6. On failure → revert
```

Component remains unaware of async logic.

---

# 💻 Updated Code

---

## 📄 App.tsx

```tsx
import React, { useState } from "react";
import Rating from "./components/Rating";

function App() {
  const [rating, setRating] = useState<number>(-1);
  const [loading, setLoading] = useState<boolean>(false);

  const handleRatingChange = async (newRating: number) => {
    if (loading) return;

    const previousRating = rating;

    // Optimistic update
    setRating(newRating);
    setLoading(true);

    try {
      await simulateApiCall();
      setLoading(false);
    } catch (error) {
      // Rollback
      setRating(previousRating);
      setLoading(false);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Rate this product</h2>

      <Rating
        value={rating}
        onChange={handleRatingChange}
        totalItems={5}
      />

      {loading && <p>Saving...</p>}
    </div>
  );
}

function simulateApiCall(): Promise<void> {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      const success = Math.random() > 0.3;
      success ? resolve() : reject();
    }, 1000);
  });
}

export default App;
```

---

## 🎤 What You Say After Writing It

> "The parent now performs an optimistic update.  
> The rating updates immediately for responsiveness.  
> If the simulated API fails, the state rolls back to the previous value.  
> I also prevent duplicate requests while loading."

That’s a strong, structured explanation.

---

# 🔎 What Interviewer Is Evaluating

- Did you keep separation of concerns?
    
- Did you maintain controlled pattern?
    
- Did you handle rollback properly?
    
- Did you prevent race conditions?
    
- Did you think like a product engineer?
    

---

# 🧠 What You Just Demonstrated

You showed:

```
UI component → pure
Parent → state + async logic
```

That’s textbook React architecture.

You also handled:

- Async flow
    
- Optimistic UI
    
- Failure case
    
- Loading state
    
- State rollback
    

This is senior-level thinking.

---

# ⚠️ Subtle Improvement (Optional Discussion)

If interviewer pushes further, they may ask:

- What about multiple rapid clicks?
    
- What about cancellation?
    
- What about debouncing?
    
- What about accessibility during loading?
    

We haven’t handled keyboard or ARIA yet.

That’s next-level refinement.

---

# ⏸ Pause Here

Next possible directions:

1. Improve accessibility (keyboard + ARIA)
    
2. Refactor for performance (memoization)
    
3. Add dynamic color scaling (low = red, high = green)
    
4. Make icon fully customizable (render prop pattern)
    
5. Support controlled + uncontrolled pattern
    

Which direction do you want to explore next?
