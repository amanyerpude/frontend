This is a **very powerful move**.

You don’t want help solving just one problem.  
You want a **meta-prompt** that forces structured thinking for _any_ frontend machine coding question.

Good. That’s how you become interview-ready.

Below is a **generic reusable prompt** you can paste into ChatGPT after sharing any machine coding question.

It is designed to:

- Force incremental breakdown
    
- Simulate real interview pacing
    
- Avoid one-shot solutions
    
- Cover UI, state, UX, architecture, async, edge cases
    
- Work for React / Vanilla JS / Framework-agnostic problems
    
- Avoid assumptions
    
- Maintain production mindset

# 🔥 Universal Machine Coding Breakdown Prompt

You can copy everything below and reuse it.

```
I am preparing for frontend machine coding interviews.

I will share a machine coding question below.

Your task is NOT to solve it in one response.

Instead:

1. First, analyze the problem deeply.
2. Do not assume missing requirements.
3. Identify:
   - Core functional requirements
   - Edge cases
   - UX complexities
   - State management needs
   - Architectural considerations
   - Possible async/system design extensions
   - Accessibility concerns
   - Performance considerations
   - Reusability requirements

4. Then create a structured, incremental implementation plan as if this were a real interview.

5. The breakdown must:
   - Be step-by-step
   - Simulate real interview coding progression
   - Start from minimal working version
   - Gradually increase complexity
   - Avoid jumping ahead
   - Explain what I would say to the interviewer at each step
   - Explain what the interviewer is evaluating at each step
   - Highlight common failure points
   - Indicate when a step signals mid-level vs senior-level thinking

6. Do NOT provide the final full solution in one response.

7. After presenting each step:
   - Pause and wait for me to say “next”.

8. Each step must include:
   - What I say to the interviewer
   - What I am thinking internally
   - What code I write
   - What the interviewer is evaluating
   - What mistakes to avoid

9. Keep it realistic:
   - No overengineering
   - No unnecessary abstractions too early
   - Add architecture improvements only when justified
   - Add async/system design only when logically extended

10. Simulate a real 45-minute machine coding round.

Now here is the machine coding question:

# 🧠 Why This Prompt Works

It forces ChatGPT to:

- Think like an interviewer
    
- Think incrementally
    
- Avoid dumping solution
    
- Cover hidden bar-raiser parts
    
- Surface evaluation criteria
    
- Train you in communication, not just coding

# 🏆 Bonus: Senior-Level Upgrade Version

If you want a more intense breakdown, add this line at the end:

```
After finishing all steps, also:
- Provide hidden follow-up questions interviewers may ask
- Provide optimization discussion points
- Provide how to refactor into production-grade architecture
- Provide how this problem would scale in a large application
```

---

If you want, I can also give you:

- 🎯 A React-specific version
    
- 🎯 A Vanilla JS specific version
    
- 🎯 A system-design-heavy version
    
- 🎯 A time-boxed 30-minute survival version
    
- 🎯 A brutal FAANG-style version
    

Tell me what level you’re targeting.
