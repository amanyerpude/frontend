## I. Introduction to Rendering Patterns Series

The video sets the stage for the entire series, which focuses on gradually building the foundation necessary to understand complex rendering patterns.

### A. Core Patterns to be Covered

The whole series will revolve around four fundamental rendering patterns:

1. **CSR** (Client-Side Rendering)
2. **SSR** (Server-Side Rendering)
3. **SSG** (Static Site Generation)
4. **ISSG** (Incremental Site Regeneration)

The video notes that understanding pre-rendering is crucial, as it makes grasping the concepts of CSR, SSR, SSG, and ISSG much easier.

## II. Scenario: No Pre-rendering (The CSR Example)

To establish the concept of pre-rendering, the video first details the process when **no pre-rendering** takes place. A simple React application created via `create-react-app` is used as a basic example of **Client-Side Rendering (CSR)**.

### A. The No Pre-rendering Process

1. **Initial Server Response:** The server sends an HTML file to the browser.
2. **Empty HTML:** The received HTML file is mostly empty, containing only placeholder elements (like a `div ID root`).
3. **Visible Result:** Because there is nothing inside the placeholder `div`, the user sees a **blank screen** on the first load. The initial HTML sent did not contain any visible content and was **not pre-rendered**.
4. **Loading React:** The browser requests the JavaScript (JS) file containing the React code.
5. **Execution and Filling:** Once the browser receives the JS file, the React code executes (running lifecycle methods) and then fills the empty `div` with components.
6. **Content Appearance:** Only at this point does the user see **visible content** on the screen.

### B. User Experience

This process is considered a **bad user experience**, especially if the JS bundle is heavy, forcing the user to wait until the JS is loaded and the React code runs to see content.

---

## III. Key Terminology: Hydration

The term **Hydration** is introduced as an important piece of terminology (lingo) essential for understanding rendering patterns.

### A. Definition

Hydration is when the web page **becomes interactive** after the browser is loaded with the necessary JavaScript logic.

### B. Analogy

The process is compared to a human drinking water (hydrating) to become responsive and energized after feeling low. Similarly, when the application "drinks" or is loaded with JavaScript, it gets energized, becomes active, and becomes **interactive**.

---

## IV. Scenario: With Pre-rendering

Pre-rendering occurs when the HTML file is **pre-rendered on the server** before being sent to the client. This method can be associated with approaches like **SSR** (Server-Side Rendering).

### A. The Pre-rendering Process

1. **Initial Server Response:** The server sends a **complete HTML file** to the browser.
2. **Visible Result:** The browser receives the complete HTML and **displays the visible content immediately** on the screen.
3. **Functionality Pending:** The only thing missing at this stage is the JavaScript, which will add functionality and interactivity.
4. **Hydration:** The JavaScript loads, and hydration occurs, making the application interactive.

### B. Benefits and User Experience

- **Better Experience:** This results in a **better user experience** because the content is seen right away.
- **Invisible Hydration:** The user does **not visually perceive** the moment the application is hydrated because the content was already visible. The hydration happens "behind the scenes" or in the background.

## V. Conclusion and Next Steps

The video emphasizes that the series will progress gradually to ensure a **crystal clear knowledge** of these complex patterns without overwhelming the beginner. Upcoming videos will discuss the specifics of CSR, SSR, SSG, and ISSG in depth, covering all scenarios.
