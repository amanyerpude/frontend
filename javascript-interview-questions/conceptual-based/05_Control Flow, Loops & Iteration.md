# 🔁 Control Flow, Loops & Iteration

1. What is the difference between `for...in` and `for...of`?
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
# **1️⃣ What is the difference between `for...in` and `for...of`?**

---

## ✅ **How to Answer in an Interview**

- Begin by explaining that **both are looping constructs**, but they iterate differently.
    
- Emphasize that `for...in` is used for **enumerating object keys**, while `for...of` is used for **iterating over iterable values (arrays, strings, maps, sets)**.
    
- Provide **side-by-side examples**.
    

---

## 💡 **Answer**

|Feature|`for...in`|`for...of`|
|---|---|---|
|Iterates Over|**Keys (property names)** of an object|**Values** of an iterable (array, string, map, set)|
|Use Case|Objects|Arrays, strings, maps, sets|
|Return Value|Keys (as strings)|Actual values|

---

## 🧩 **Example**

### ✅ **Using `for...in` (Keys)**

```js
const user = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };

for (let key in user) {
  console.log(key);        // name, age
  console.log(user[key]);  // Alice, 25
}
```

---

### ✅ **Using `for...of` (Values)**

```js
const numbers = [10, 20, 30];

for (let num of numbers) {
  console.log(num); // 10, 20, 30
}
```

# 🔄 **Trailing Questions**

---

### **1️⃣ Can you use `for...of` on objects?**

#### ✅ **How to Answer in an Interview**

- Clarify behaviour.
    

#### 💡 **Answer**

No. Objects are **not iterable** by default. To iterate over objects, use:

```js
for (let [key, value] of Object.entries(user)) {
  console.log(key, value);
}
```

---

### **2️⃣ What is the difference between `forEach()` and `for...of`?**

#### ✅ **How to Answer in an Interview**

- Highlight key difference.
    

#### 💡 **Answer**

- `forEach()` is a **method on arrays**.
    
- `for...of` works on **any iterable**.
    
- `for...of` supports `break` and `continue`, while `forEach()` does **not**.
    

---

### **3️⃣ Which loop is better for arrays?**

#### ✅ **How to Answer in an Interview**

- Provide best practice.
    

#### 💡 **Answer**

Use `for...of` for simple value iteration. Use `forEach()` for functional callbacks. Use `for...in` **only for objects**.

---

### **4️⃣ How can you iterate over Maps and Sets?**

#### ✅ **How to Answer in an Interview**

- Show example.
    

#### 💡 **Answer**

```js
const map = new Map([["a", 1], ["b", 2]]);
for (let [key, value] of map) console.log(key, value);

const set = new Set([1, 2, 3]);
for (let value of set) console.log(value);
```

## 🎯 **Interview Tips**

✅ Always mention **keys vs values difference**.  
✅ Provide **side-by-side examples**.  
✅ Bonus points for **explaining when to use Object.keys/entries with for...of**.

🔥 Do you want me to **continue with more Control Flow, Loops & Iteration questions (like `break` vs `continue`, while vs do...while, etc.)** or will you provide the next question list?

For **Control Flow, Loops & Iteration**, common frontend interview questions usually include these 👇

## 📌 **Core Control Flow Questions**

1. What is the difference between `if`, `else if`, and `switch` statements?
    
2. What is the difference between `break` and `continue` in loops?
    
3. What are labeled statements in JavaScript?
    
4. How does the `try...catch...finally` block work?
    
5. How does `throw` work in error handling?
    

---

## 📌 **Loop & Iteration Questions**

6. What is the difference between `for`, `while`, and `do...while` loops?
    
7. What is the difference between `for...in` and `for...of`? ✅ _(we already covered)_
    
8. What is the difference between `forEach()` and `for...of`?

Do you want me to **prepare all these questions one by one in the same structured format we’ve been using** (definition → examples → trailing questions)?

Or should I **pick the most commonly asked ones (around 10)** and make a **complete Control Flow & Loops section**?
