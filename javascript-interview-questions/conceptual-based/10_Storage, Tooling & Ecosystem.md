# **1️⃣ What is the difference between IndexedDB and SessionStorage?**

---

## ✅ **How to Answer in an Interview**

- Start by saying **both are browser storage options but serve different purposes**.
    
- Explain that **IndexedDB is a NoSQL database for large structured data**, while **SessionStorage is a simple key-value storage for temporary data**.
    
- Use a **table for clarity**.
    

---

## 💡 **Answer**

|Feature|**IndexedDB**|**SessionStorage**|
|---|---|---|
|**Type**|NoSQL database|Key-value storage|
|**Data Size**|Stores large amounts of structured data|Small data (usually <5MB)|
|**Persistence**|Persists until deleted manually|Cleared when tab is closed|
|**Data Type**|Can store objects, files, blobs|Only stores strings|
|**Use Case**|Offline apps, caching large data sets|Temporary session data|

---

## 🧩 **Example**

```js
// SessionStorage
sessionStorage.setItem("token", "123");
console.log(sessionStorage.getItem("token"));

// IndexedDB (simplified)
const request = indexedDB.open("MyDB", 1);
request.onsuccess = () => console.log("DB opened");
```

# 🔄 **Trailing Questions**

---

### **1️⃣ When should you use IndexedDB over SessionStorage?**

#### ✅ **How to Answer in an Interview**

- When you **need to store large structured data or work offline**.
    

---

### **2️⃣ Can you store non-string data in SessionStorage?**

#### ✅ **How to Answer in an Interview**

- No, SessionStorage **stores only strings**, but you can use `JSON.stringify()`.
    

```js
sessionStorage.setItem("user", JSON.stringify({ name: "Alice" }));
console.log(JSON.parse(sessionStorage.getItem("user")).name); // Alice
```

---

## 🎯 **Interview Tips**

✅ Always highlight **IndexedDB = database, SessionStorage = key-value**.  
✅ Be ready for **follow-ups on LocalStorage vs SessionStorage (next question)**.

# **2️⃣ What is the main difference between Local Storage and Session Storage?**

---

## ✅ **How to Answer in an Interview**

- Start by saying **both store key-value pairs in the browser**.
    
- Explain that **LocalStorage persists even after the browser is closed**, whereas **SessionStorage clears when the tab is closed**.
    
- Use a **comparison table**.
    

---

## 💡 **Answer**

|Feature|**LocalStorage**|**SessionStorage**|
|---|---|---|
|**Persistence**|Data stays even after browser restart|Cleared when the tab is closed|
|**Storage Limit**|~5-10MB (depends on browser)|~5MB|

- Mention that they are **sent with every HTTP request by default**.
    
- Explain **uses (sessions, authentication, preferences)** and limitations.
    

---

## 💡 **Answer**

**Cookies** are small text files (usually <4KB) stored in the browser by websites.  
They are used to **store session information, preferences, or authentication data** and are **sent to the server with every HTTP request**.

---

### 🔹 **Types of Cookies**

1. **Session Cookies** – Deleted when the browser is closed.
    
2. **Persistent Cookies** – Stay until expiry date.
    
3. **Secure/HttpOnly Cookies** – More secure; cannot be accessed via JavaScript.
    

---

## 🧩 **Example**

```js
// Setting a cookie
document.cookie = "username=John; path=/; max-age=3600";

// Reading cookies
console.log(document.cookie); // "username=John"
```

# Storage, Tooling & Ecosystem – JavaScript Interview Prep

Below are beginner-friendly explanations, code examples, clear interview talking points, and trailing questions with their answers for each topic in the “Storage, Tooling & Ecosystem” section.

## 1. What is the difference between IndexedDB and SessionStorage?

**Explanation:**

- **IndexedDB** is a low-level API for storing significant amounts of structured data (including files/blobs) on the client. It supports advanced queries, indexes, and transactions, and the data persists even after the browser or tab is closed.
    
- **SessionStorage** is a simple key-value storage that only persists while a browser tab is open. When the tab or window is closed, all data in SessionStorage for that page disappears.
    

**Example:**

javascript

`// SessionStorage sessionStorage.setItem('user', 'Sam'); console.log(sessionStorage.getItem('user')); // "Sam" // IndexedDB (simplified, real use is more involved) let request = indexedDB.open('MyDB', 1);`

**What to say in an interview:**  
"IndexedDB allows me to store large and structured data that needs to persist long-term, using a database approach with advanced queries. SessionStorage is much simpler and is only good for small, temporary data that should disappear when the tab or window closes."

## Trailing Question: When would you choose IndexedDB over SessionStorage?

**Answer:**  
Use IndexedDB for larger or more complex persistent data (e.g., offline apps, file storage). Use SessionStorage for small, simple, temporary values needed only during the life of a tab.

**What to say:**  
"I’d use IndexedDB for things like offline web apps that need to store lots of user data, and SessionStorage for things like a tab-level login state or a wizard step tracker."

## 2. What is the main difference between Local Storage and Session Storage?

**Explanation:**

- **Local Storage** persists data even after the browser is closed and reopened. The data stays until explicitly removed.
    
- **Session Storage** is cleared when the tab or window is closed.
    

Both offer a simple key-value string storage interface, with a typical size limit of around 5–10MB per domain.

**Example:**

javascript

`// Local Storage localStorage.setItem('theme', 'dark'); console.log(localStorage.getItem('theme')); // "dark"`

**What to say in an interview:**  
"Local Storage keeps data even after closing the browser and is good for persistent preferences. Session Storage only lasts as long as the tab is open, so it’s better for short-term state."

## Trailing Question: Can you store non-strings in Local Storage?

**Answer:**  
No. Both Local Storage and Session Storage only store strings. To store objects, use `JSON.stringify()` and `JSON.parse()` to convert them.

**Example:**

javascript

`let obj = { name: "Jay" }; localStorage.setItem("person", JSON.stringify(obj)); let fromStorage = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("person"));`

**What to say:**  
"Anything saved in Local or Session Storage has to be a string, but I can use JSON to store objects."

## 3. What are cookies?

**Explanation:**  
Cookies are small pieces of data stored in key-value pairs in the browser and sent automatically with HTTP requests to the server. They:

- Can be given expiration dates (for persistence or single-session use).
    
- Are often used for authentication, tracking, or personalization.
    
- Are accessible from both the server (HTTP headers) and client (JavaScript via `document.cookie`).
    

**Example:**

javascript

`document.cookie = "username=Alex; expires=Fri, 31 Dec 2025 23:59:59 GMT; path=/"; console.log(document.cookie); // "username=Alex"`

**What to say in an interview:**  
"Cookies store small bits of data that can be sent to the server with each request—handy for things like session IDs or remembering users, but limited in size and subject to strict security controls."

## Trailing Question: How are cookies different from Local Storage?

**Answer:**

- Cookies are sent automatically with HTTP requests; Local Storage is only accessible via JavaScript.
    
- Cookies have a much smaller size limit.
    
- Cookies are used for server communication; Local Storage is client-only.
    

**What to say:**  
"Unlike Local Storage, cookies get sent to the server with every request and can have expiration rules. Local Storage is bigger and only used on the client side."

## 4. What JavaScript build tools have you used (e.g., Webpack, Babel)?

**Explanation:**  
JavaScript build tools automate tasks like code bundling, transpiling, minification, testing, and live reloading. Popular examples:

- **Webpack:** Advanced bundler for JS modules, dependencies, and static assets.
    
- **Babel:** Transpiles ES6+ (and TypeScript) code to older JavaScript for broader compatibility.
    
- **Others:** Parcel, Rollup, Gulp.
    

**Example Workflow:**

- Use Babel to convert modern JS to older syntax.
    
- Use Webpack to bundle code and assets into one file for the browser.
    

**What to say in an interview:**  
"I’ve used tools like Webpack and Babel; Webpack to bundle modules and assets for deployment, and Babel to translate modern JavaScript into versions that work everywhere. These tools help automate and streamline the development process."

## Trailing Question: Why is Babel important?

**Answer:**  
Babel lets developers write code using the latest JavaScript features, while ensuring the code will run in older browsers.

**What to say:**  
"With Babel, I don’t have to worry if every browser supports new JavaScript features—I can use the latest syntax and trust Babel to ‘backport’ it as needed."

## 5. What is the difference between TypeScript and JavaScript?

**Explanation:**

- **JavaScript:** A dynamic, interpreted scripting language used for web and app development.
    
- **TypeScript:** A superset of JavaScript that adds static type checking, interfaces, and improved tooling. TypeScript code must be compiled (transpiled) to JavaScript to run in browsers.
    

**Example:**

typescript

`// TypeScript function add(a: number, b: number): number {   return a + b; } // JavaScript version: function add(a, b) {   return a + b; }`

**What to say in an interview:**  
"TypeScript is just like JavaScript but with type checking and better tooling to catch mistakes early. All valid JavaScript is valid TypeScript, but TypeScript gives me extra safety and features."

## Trailing Question: Why would you choose TypeScript over JavaScript?

**Answer:**  
TypeScript helps catch bugs early, improves code readability, and makes refactoring and maintaining large codebases much easier, due to its type safety.

**What to say:**  
"I’d use TypeScript in larger projects or with teams, because types help prevent bugs, clarify intent, and make my code easier to maintain and refactor."
