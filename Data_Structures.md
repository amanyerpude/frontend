âš¡ Flow explanation:

- Start with **fundamentals (stack, queue, list, objects)**
    
- Then **linked lists and their variations (doubly, circular, deque)**
    
- Next **priority-based and hierarchical structures (priority queue, tree, heap)**
    
- Finally **advanced/modern structures (treap, trie, graph, AVL tree)**
    

Do you want me to also create a **difficulty tag** for each (like `#easy`, `#medium`, `#hard`) so that in Obsidian you can filter which DS to tackle first?
