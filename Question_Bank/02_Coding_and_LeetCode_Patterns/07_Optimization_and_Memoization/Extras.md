Absolutely, Shrey! Here's a focused list of **frequently asked Optimization & Memoization problems** â€” especially relevant in **frontend interviews**, performance-sensitive UI logic, and DSA rounds.

These questions typically test your understanding of:

- Caching
    
- Function re-computation avoidance
    
- Space/time trade-offs
    
- Real-world performance strategies (e.g., Reactâ€™s `useMemo`, debounce, throttle)

## âœ… **Frequently Asked Memoization & Optimization Problems**

### ðŸ”¹ **Function-Level Memoization**

1. **Implement `memoize(fn)`** âœ…
    
2. **Memoize a recursive function (e.g., Fibonacci with memoization)**
    
3. **Memoize an async function**
    
4. **Create a timed cache (entries expire after N ms)**
    
5. **Implement LRU Cache (Least Recently Used)**
    
6. **Debounce vs Throttle: Implement both**
    
7. **Use memoization to optimize recursive DFS (e.g., climbing stairs with memo)**
    
8. **Implement `once(fn)` â€“ only allow a function to run once**

### ðŸ”¹ **React & Frontend Optimization Concepts**

16. **What does `useMemo` do? When should you avoid it?**
    
17. **Explain `useCallback` and when to use it**
    
18. **Why memoization can hurt performance in React**
    
19. **React.memo vs useMemo vs useCallback**
    
20. **Optimize re-renders in a list with large data (key prop, virtualization)**
    
21. **Why is `key` important in a React list?**

### ðŸ”¹ **Real-World Application Patterns**

22. **Implement an in-memory cache for API responses**
    
23. **Create a hook that caches expensive computed values**
    
24. **Build a search input with debounce optimization**
    
25. **Cache scroll position between routes**
    
26. **Avoid re-sorting filtered lists unnecessarily (memoized sort/filter)**

Would you like:

- A **roadmap to learn these in priority order**?
    
- A **practice checklist** or **daily schedule**?
    

We can also pick the next one (e.g., `LRU Cache`, `debounce/throttle`, or `memoized Fibonacci`) and solve it step-by-step like before.
