Awesome! Let’s start with a **classic backtracking problem** — one of the most asked recursion challenges:

## 🔹 **Problem 1: Generate Valid Parenthesis Pairs**

### 🧠 **Interview-style Question Statement:**

> Given `n` pairs of parentheses, generate **all combinations of well-formed (valid) parentheses**.
> 
> Example:  
> Input: `getpair(3)`  
> Output:
> 
> ```
> [
>   "((()))",
>   "(()())",
>   "(())()",
>   "()(())",
>   "()()()"
> ]
> ```

## 🧱 **Step-by-Step Beginner Explanation**

### 🎯 Your Goal:

You need to generate **only valid** combinations — every `(` must be matched by a `)` after it.

This is a **backtracking** problem:

- You build the string step-by-step
    
- At each step, you make a decision:
    
    - Add `(` if you have any left
        
    - Add `)` only if you’ve already added more `(` than `)` (to ensure balance)
        
- You **backtrack** when you reach an invalid state or complete one path

### ✅ **Recursive Backtracking Approach**

```js
function getpair(n) {
  const result = [];

  function backtrack(open, close, current) {
    if (current.length === n * 2) {
      result.push(current);
      return;
    }

    if (open < n) {
      backtrack(open + 1, close, current + "(");
    }

    if (close < open) {
      backtrack(open, close + 1, current + ")");
    }
  }

  backtrack(0, 0, "");
  return result;
}
```

### 🔍 **Explanation:**

- `open`: number of `(` used so far
    
- `close`: number of `)` used so far
    
- `current`: the current partial string being built
    
- Base case: when `current.length === n * 2`, push it into the result

### 🧪 Walkthrough for `n = 2`:

It builds:

- `(())`
    
- `()()`
    

It will **never** build `())(` because the `close < open` rule blocks that.

### 🧠 What You Say in an Interview:

> “I used backtracking. At each step, I added an open bracket if I had any left, or a closing one only if it wouldn’t unbalance the string. This ensures only valid parentheses are explored.”

### ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity

|Type|Complexity|
|---|---|
|Time|O(2ⁿ) to O(4ⁿ / √n) — Catalan number growth|
|Space|O(n) per path, O(#paths) total|
