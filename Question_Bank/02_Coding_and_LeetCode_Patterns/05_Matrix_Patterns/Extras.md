Absolutely, Shrey. Here’s a curated list of **frequently asked Matrix Pattern Problems** and **2D-array-based challenges** — especially relevant for **frontend interviews** that focus on logical reasoning, nested iteration, and visual layouts.

These test your ability to:

- Navigate grids
    
- Recognize patterns (diagonal, spiral, zigzag, etc.)
    
- Optimize space/time in 2D iterations

Would you like:

- These sorted by **difficulty level** or **topic clusters** (e.g. “search” vs “print”)?
    
- Or shall we pick the next one (e.g., **Spiral Order**, **Matrix Rotation**) and go step-by-step like before?
