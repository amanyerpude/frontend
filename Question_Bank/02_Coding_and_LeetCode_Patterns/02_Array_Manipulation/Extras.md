Here’s a broader and more **comprehensive list** of foundational and **interview-relevant array problems**, especially valuable for **frontend roles** (JS-focused), **DSA rounds**, and **real-world logic questions**.

I’ll break it down into **7 core categories** to make sure you’re getting **complete and non-redundant** coverage.

## 🔹 1. **Searching & Indexing**

- Find index of target in sorted array (Binary Search)
    
- Find first and last occurrence of an element
    
- Search in rotated sorted array (LeetCode #33)
    
- Find peak element (Binary Search variation)
    
- Find rotation count in rotated sorted array

## 🔹 2. **Subarray & Sliding Window**

- Maximum sum subarray of size `k` (Fixed-size window)
    
- Longest subarray with sum = k
    
- Longest substring/array with unique characters/elements (Variable-size window)
    
- Longest subarray with 0s and 1s equally
    
- Count number of subarrays with sum divisible by `k`
    
- Minimum size subarray sum (LeetCode #209)

## 🔹 3. **Sorting & Partitioning**

- Sort 0s, 1s and 2s (Dutch National Flag — LeetCode #75)
    
- Merge overlapping intervals
    
- Wiggle sort
    
- Sort an array with squares of a sorted array
    
- Cyclic sort for values in range [1, n]

## 🔹 4. **Counting & Hashing**

- Count frequencies using map or object
    
- Count elements with a given frequency
    
- Find element appearing more than `n/2` times (Moore’s Voting Algorithm)
    
- Find all elements appearing more than `n/3` times
    
- Find missing and repeating number (with XOR or Map)
    
- Count pairs with a given difference

## 🔹 5. **Two Pointer / Greedy**

- Container With Most Water
    
- Trapping Rain Water
    
- Remove duplicates (in-place for sorted array)
    
- Move negative numbers to left, positives to right
    
- Maximize sum after k negations
    
- Minimum number of platforms / meeting rooms

## 🔹 6. **Mathematical / Transformational**

- Rotate matrix (in-place)
    
- Spiral traversal of matrix
    
- Diagonal traversal
    
- Transpose of matrix
    
- Pascal’s Triangle generation
    
- Maximum product subarray
    

---

## 🔹 7. **Logical & Combinatorial**

- Can jump to the end of array (Jump Game)
    
- Generate all subsets (powerset)
    
- Generate all permutations of array
    
- Subset sum problem (backtracking/dp)
    
- Partition array into equal subsets
    
- Find the equilibrium index (prefix/suffix sum)

### 🧠 Summary:

You can build a 50–60 question **golden list** of array problems — covering every concept an interviewer could reasonably test.

Want me to send you:

- A curated **"Top 30 problems" shortlist** (sorted by learning value)?
    
- Or turn this into a **Notion tracker**, **PDF**, or **daily challenge list**?
    

Also, would you like to **start solving** from the next uncategorized one — say, **“Move Zeroes to End”**?
