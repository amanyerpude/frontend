## TypeScript: Overview and Core Concepts

### I. Definition and Purpose

- **What TypeScript Is:**
    - TypeScript is a **programming language based on JavaScript** that is becoming increasingly popular.
    - It is often called a **superset of JavaScript**.
    - This means **everything that you can do in JavaScript is already available in TypeScript**, and **a lot more is available** to that.
    - It is a **development tool**.
    - It is accurately described as a **layer on top of JavaScript** or a **wrapper around JavaScript**.
    - TypeScript is **entirely dependent on JavaScript**.
    - It allows you to **write JavaScript in a much precise manner** so that your code faces a **lot less error in the runtime**.
    - The goal is to provide **full knowledge and full right-table skills** to transform from JavaScript to TypeScript.
- **Context:**
    - The **entire world is currently "traumed" by JavaScript**. Everybody is writing JavaScript, regardless of whether they love it or hate it.
    - TypeScript is the **"new kit in the town"**. Those who start writing it claim they **don't want to go back into writing JavaScript**.

### II. Core Philosophy: Type Safety and Static Checking

- **Type Safety:**
    - TypeScript is **all about TypeSafety, nothing else**.
    - It asks that you **write JavaScript with a little bit more accurate behavior**.
    - Type Safety prevents **"odd behavior"** that JavaScript allows, such as **adding the number 2 with the string "2"** (which results in "22"), or **adding 2 to `null` or `undefined`** (resulting in `2` and `NaN`).
    - It ensures that if you are **consistent with your type**, mismatching of types should not occur.
- **Static Checking:**
    - The **simple idea behind TypeScript is static checking**. **That's the only job** TypeScript has.
    - Static checking is present in many languages, such as **Java or GoLang**.
    - It means the language's **parser or syntax is constantly being analyzed by the IDEs** while writing the code.
    - Errors are **already being displayed to you while writing the code**, contrasting with JavaScript, where errors are usually **only thrown when the code executes**.

### III. Misconceptions about TypeScript (What it is NOT)

- It is **not adding more features to JavaScript** (e.g., it does not give you more callbacks or arrow functions).
- It is **not going to give you a new loop, classes, or new modules**.
- It is **not about reinventing the entire JavaScript language**.
- It is **not a standalone language in itself**.
- The belief that **you write less code** with TypeScript is false; **the reverse is true**. You write a **lot more code** in TypeScript compared to JavaScript, sometimes with **50 lines of TS code compiled into just 10 lines of JavaScript**.

### IV. Usage Guidance and Prerequisites

- You **should start with JavaScript** first.
- The code sent to production is still **pure 100% JavaScript code**.
- It is **not compulsory that every single place you need to write TSX or TS**.
- You **shouldn't be using TypeScript** if your project is **too far along and has only five or ten lines of code in each file**.
- If you use TypeScript, you must use its "super power" to make your code **much more powerful and much more error prone**. Using it **just for the fanciness of writing TS** is incorrect.

---

## TypeScript Development Flow and Setup

### I. Code Processing and File Types

- All code written in TypeScript is **finally compiled into JavaScript**.
- TypeScript code is **transpiled (or converted) into JavaScript**.
- Even if the code editor is **yelling at you with a squiggly line**, you are **still allowed to compile that code into JavaScript**, and it might run (possibly with errors).
- The simple TypeScript format uses the extension **`.ts`**.
- For building components like React, **`.tsx`** is used, which is a **mixture of TypeScript plus the JSX kind of syntax**.
- The TypeScript syntax (e.g., type annotations like `: Boolean`) is **removed during compilation** and is absent from the final JavaScript file.

### II. Installation and Basic Setup (TSC)

- **Installation Prerequisites:**
    - **Node must be installed** (check with `node -V`). Node provides the utility **NPM (Node Package Manager)**.
    - Windows users are recommended to use **GitBash or PowerShell**.
- **Installation Methods:**
    - The command `npm install typescript` is used for installation.
    - It can be installed **globally** (`-g` flag) for learning core concepts.
    - In projects, it is usually installed as a **dev dependency** (`npm install typescript --save-dev`) because it is a development tool.
    - On Linux/Mac, `sudo` might be required; on Windows, run as administrator.
- **TypeScript Compiler (TSC):**
    - Successful installation provides access to the unique command **`TSC` (TypeScript Compiler)**.
    - `TSC` executes the TypeScript file, and the version can be checked with **`TSC -V`**.
    - The core functionality demonstrated uses **`TSC [filename].ts`** to automatically generate a corresponding **`.js` file**.

### III. Production Setup

- **Configuration:** The project is initialized using **`TSC --init`**, which creates a **`tsconfig.json`** file.
- **Directories:** Standard practice uses a **`source` (src) folder** for writing TS code and a **`dist` (distribution) folder** for the JavaScript output served to the end user.
- **Linking:** The `index.html` file must link to the generated JavaScript file inside the distribution folder (e.g., `dist/index.js`).
- **`tsconfig.json`:** The `outDir` (output directory) setting must be configured to point to the `dist` file.
- **Watch Mode:** The command **`TSC -w` (watch mode)** is used to continuously run compilation and watch for changes, relying on the `tsconfig.json` file.
- **Server:** A server is required to load `index.html`. Options include the **Live Server VS Code extension** (preferred by the instructor), **Light-Server**, or **NodeMon**. The instructor uses dark mode (`background-color: 313131`) for the body styling.

## TypeScript Data Types and Syntax

### I. Basic Type System

- **Variables Declaration:** Use `let` or `const`, followed by the variable name, a colon, and the type (e.g., `let greetings: string;`).
- **Case Convention:** Almost all types in TypeScript (e.g., `string`, `number`, `boolean`) are **lowercase**.
- **Numeric Types:** JavaScript and TypeScript **do not have special runtime values for integers** (no `int` or `float` equivalent). All numeric values, including decimals, are defined as **`number`** (singular).

### II. Type Inference (Best Practice)

- TypeScript is **smart**.
- If a variable is **immediately assigned a value** (e.g., `let userId = 334466;`), TypeScript automatically **infers the type**.
- In such obvious cases, **explicit type annotation is redundant** and overuses TypeScript; it is a **better coding practice to rely on inference**.
- Even with inference, TypeScript still provides safety checks and **will issue errors** if an incorrect type is assigned later.

### III. The `any` Keyword

- `any` is a **marker in TypeScript** that **turns off the type checking** for a particular value.
- It is **not a type** like string or boolean.
- It is often implicitly inferred when TypeScript cannot determine the type of a variable or function return.
- **It is not a good practice** to use `any`. The official documentation states, **"You usually want to avoid this because any isn't type checked"**.
- The compiler flag **`noImplicitAny`** can be set in `tsconfig.json` to flag implicit `any` usage as an error.

### IV. Functions and Return Types

- **Parameter Typing:** Function parameters must be explicitly typed (e.g., `number: number`). If not typed, they can be inferred as `any`, defeating type safety.
- **Return Type Typing:** The expected return type is annotated **after the parameter parentheses** using a colon (e.g., `(num: number): number => { ... }`).
    - Explicitly typing the return value ensures consistency and **prevents developers from returning an unexpected type** (e.g., returning a `string` when a `number` is expected).
- **Default Values:** Default values are added after the type annotation (e.g., `isPaid: boolean = false`).
- **`void`:** Used when a function **returns nothing ever**.
- **`never`:** Used when a function is intended to **never return a value** because it **throws an exception or terminates execution**. This is recommended for robust error handling.
- **Setter Methods:** A setter function (using the `set` keyword in classes) **cannot have a return type annotation** (not even `void`).

### V. Objects and Type Aliases

- **Object Use:** Objects are primarily used for **passing data to or returning data from functions**.
- **Defining Return Objects:** The syntax for defining a function's object return type is noted as "weird" and "confusing," where the structure is placed after the return type colon.
- **JavaScript Quirks:** If an object is created as a variable _before_ being passed to a function, the function **will allow extra properties** on that object, even if the function definition restricts them.
- **Type Aliases:**
    - Defined using the keyword **`type`**.
    - They are used to **reuse the same long set of properties** across multiple function signatures.
    - The alias name can then replace the lengthy type definition (e.g., `function print(pt: Point)`).

### VI. Advanced Type Features

- **`readonly`:** Used on properties in Types or Interfaces (e.g., `readonly _id: string`) to ensure the property **can be read but cannot be modified or reassigned**. This is a pure TypeScript feature.
- **Optional Properties:** The question mark **`?`** placed **before the colon** marks a property as optional (e.g., `ccDetails?: number`).
- **Union Types (`|`):** Allows a variable to accept **multiple possible data types** (e.g., `string | number`).
    - Union types should be **narrowed down** using checks like `typeof` inside functions before applying type-specific methods.
    - For arrays, the union must be wrapped in parentheses (e.g., `(string | number)[]`) to allow mixed types; otherwise, it means "either all strings OR all numbers".
- **Intersection Types (`&`):** Used to **combine all properties** from two or more existing types into a new type.
- **Literal Types:** Restricts a variable to **only specific literal values** (e.g., `3.14` or `"aisle" | "middle" | "window"`).

## TypeScript Structures: Arrays, Tuples, Enums, Interfaces, and Classes

### I. Arrays

- **Declaration:** Arrays can be defined using suffix notation (`string[]`) or generic notation (`Array<string>`). Both are structurally equivalent.
- Arrays can contain custom types defined by Type Aliases (e.g., `User[]`).
- **Multidimensional Arrays** can be defined (e.g., `number[][]`).

### II. Tuples

- Tuples are a **specialized array** that enforce a **precise order** of data types within the array.
- Example: Defining an RGB array strictly as `[number, number, number]`.
- **Caution:** Despite the restrictions, tuples are still arrays, and standard array methods like **`.push()`, `.unshift()`, and `.shift()` can still be used to override the defined length and type structure**.

### III. Enums

- **Purpose:** To **restrict a user's choice** to a limited set of named constants (e.g., seat choices, order statuses).
- **Default Behavior:** By default, the first value gets `0`, and subsequent values auto-increment. You can set the starting number or assign strings.
- **Compiler Output (IIFE):** Standard enum compilation generates a large Immediately Invoked Function Expression (IIFE) in JavaScript.
- **Best Practice (`const enum`):** Using **`const enum`** prevents the compiler from generating too much code and results in a cleaner JavaScript output (simple constant assignments).

### IV. Interfaces

- **Role:** Interfaces define **protocols or guidelines** that a class _must_ follow. They define required properties and method signatures but **do not contain logic or implementation details**.
- **Reopening:** Interfaces can be **reopened** by redeclaring them with the same name, allowing for **additional properties or methods to be injected**.
- **Inheritance:** Interfaces use the keyword **`extends`** to inherit properties from other interfaces.
- **Implementation:** Classes use the keyword **`implements`** to adhere to one or more interfaces (e.g., `class YouTube implements TakePhoto, Story`). If a class implements an interface, it **must define all required properties and methods**.

### V. Classes

- **Access Modifiers (Access Modifier Limits Ability):**
    - **`public`:** Default. Accessible everywhere (class, object, inheriting classes).
    - **`private`:** Accessible **only within the class**. Private members are not inherited.
    - **`protected`:** Accessible **within the class AND in any class that inherits it**, but not accessible outside via object instantiation.
    - **Shortcut Syntax:** Modifiers (e.g., `public`) can be placed directly on constructor arguments to simultaneously declare the property, type, and assign `this.property = property`.
- **Inheritance:** Classes use the keyword **`extends`** to inherit. Inheriting classes with constructors **must call `super()`** to pass required values to the parent constructor.
- **Getters and Setters:**
    - Getters (using `get`) must return a value.
    - Setters (using `set`) **cannot have a return type annotation** (even `void`).
- **Abstract Classes:**
    - Defined using **`abstract class`**.
    - Abstract classes **cannot be instantiated** (`new AbstractClass()`).
    - They are designed to be inherited (`extends`).
    - They can contain **concrete (implemented) methods**.
    - They can also define **abstract methods** (using `abstract methodName()`), which are compulsory methods that must be implemented by the inheriting class.

### VI. Generics

- **Function Generics:** Generics make functions reusable by allowing them to accept and return any data type while **locking the type information**.
    - Syntax uses angular brackets (e.g., `<T>`) to define type variables.
    - Generic constraints use **`extends`** to restrict the type variable to a specific base type or interface (e.g., `<T extends Database>`).
- **Class Generics:** Classes can be defined generically (e.g., `class Sellable<T>`) to handle common operations on different types of objects, such as `Quiz` or `Course`.

## TypeScript Narrowing and Cautionary Tales

Type narrowing is the process of precisely identifying a variable's type within conditional blocks to ensure safe operations.

- **Type Guard (`typeof`):** Used to check primitive types. _Caution:_ `typeof []` and `typeof null` both return `"object"`.
- **`in` Operator:** Used to check **if a property exists within an object or interface**. This is valuable for determining which interface type an object belongs to (e.g., checking if `isAdmin` exists in an `Account`).
- **`instanceof` Operator:** Used to check if an object was **constructed using the `new` keyword** (e.g., `instanceof Date` or classes).
- **Type Predicates (The `is` keyword):** Custom functions can explicitly narrow types using the syntax `(pet: Fish | Bird): pet is Fish` as the return type. This guarantees that if the function returns true, the object is specifically narrowed to the declared type (e.g., `Fish`).
- **Discriminated Unions (The `kind` property):** A technique where all types/interfaces in a union define a shared property (e.g., `kind: "circle"`) with a literal string value. This property is used in `switch` statements for exhaustive checking.
- **Exhaustive Checking (The `never` Type):** When using `switch` statements on a union type, a **`default` case** should be included that attempts to assign the variable to the **`never`** type. If a new type is added to the union (e.g., `Rectangle`) but not added to the switch cases, the `never` assignment will cause the compiler to **yell at you**, ensuring that the code is updated to handle all possibilities.
