## TypeScript Full Course Overview and Fundamentals

The provided source is an excerpt from a tutorial series titled **"TypeScript Full Course for Beginners | Complete All-in-One Tutorial | 8 Hours"**.

### Core Concepts and Definitions

- **Length and Structure:** The video contains **over eight hours** of tutorials and instruction. It is structured as **17 tutorials (chapters)** that build upon each other.
- **Definition:** TypeScript is **JavaScript with Syntax for types**. It is a **strongly typed programming language** that builds on JavaScript.
- **Purpose:** TypeScript is a **developer's tool** that helps you write better JavaScript. It provides **better tooling at any scale**.
- **Relationship to JavaScript:** TypeScript is a **superset of the JavaScript language**, meaning it extends JavaScript.
- **Compilation:** TypeScript **compiles to JavaScript**. This capability allows TS to compile JS compatible with **older browsers**.
- **Origin and Creator:** TypeScript was created by **Microsoft**. The person who created TypeScript is **Anders Hejlsberg**, who also created C#.
- **Popularity:** JavaScript is the most popular programming/scripting language (for the last decade), but TypeScript is in the **fifth position** according to the Stack Overflow developer survey.
- **Prerequisite:** A fundamental understanding of **JavaScript fundamentals** is required before learning TypeScript.

### Typing Terminology (Lesson 2)

|Term|Definition/Context|TS/JS Example|
|:--|:--|:--|
|**Strongly Typed**|Requires specification of data types. Helps with self-documentation and enforcement.|**TypeScript**|
|**Loosely/Weakly Typed**|Does not require type specification.|**JavaScript**|
|**Static Typing**|Types are checked at **compile time** (during development). TS is great for teams and catches errors before running.|**TypeScript**|
|**Dynamic Typing**|Types are checked at **runtime**.|**JavaScript**|
|**Inference (Implicit)**|TypeScript "figures out" the data type automatically.|`let myName = "Dave";` infers `string`|
|**Explicit Typing**|The type is strictly stated using annotation (colon notation).|`let myName: string = "Dave";`|

### Basic and Union Types (Lessons 2 & 4)

TypeScript enforces types; attempting to assign a `number` to a variable explicitly defined as a `string` will cause a compiler error.

- **Basic Types Covered:** `string`, `number`, `boolean`.
- **The `any` Type:** Defeats TypeScript's purpose as it allows any type of value. It may be used when the type of incoming data is unknown.
- **Union Types:** Allow a variable to be one of several types, separated by a pipe (`|`). Example: `let album: string | number`. Union types are not limited to just two data types.
- **The `RegExp` Type:** TypeScript can infer the `RegExp` type for regular expressions.
- **The `void` Type:** Used as a return type for functions that **do not explicitly return anything** (functions with side effects, e.g., `console.log`).
- **The `never` Type:** Used for functions that **explicitly throw errors** (`throw new Error(...)`) or functions that contain an **infinite/endless loop**. Seeing `never` inferred suggests a potential infinite loop problem. It can be used for exhaustiveness checking inside type guards.

## TypeScript Setup and Configuration (Lesson 1)

### Environment and Installation

1. **Code Editor:** **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** is used due to its popularity and tight integration with TypeScript. Download site: `code.visualstudio.com`.
2. **Node.js:** Must be installed to get **npm** (Node Package Manager). The **LTS version** is recommended.
3. **Global TS Installation:** In the terminal, run `npm i typescript -g`.
4. **Watch Mode:** To automatically recompile on changes, use `TSC <filename> -W` or `TSC -w` (when using a config file).

### `tsconfig.json` Configuration

The configuration file is created using `TSC --init`.

|Setting|Purpose / Value Example|Detail|
|:--|:--|:--|
|**`rootDir`**|Specifies the directory containing TypeScript source files.|Set to `./Source` when using the standard scalable project structure.|
|**`outDir`**|Specifies where compiled JavaScript files should be output.|Set to `./build/js` for a scalable project structure.|
|**`target`**|Sets the JavaScript version the code compiles to.|`es2016` uses `let`. `es5` uses `var` (for older browser compatibility).|
|**`include`**|An optional array added to the bottom of the file to specify which directories contain TS files to compile.|Set to `["Source"]` to ignore TS files placed in the root directory.|
|**`noEmitOnError`**|Prevents TypeScript from compiling a JS file if there are compilation errors in the TS source.|Set to `true` in `tsconfig.json`. Can be overridden via command line: `TSC --noEmitOnError -W`.|

## Arrays, Tuples, Objects, and Classes (Lessons 3 & 6)

### Arrays and Tuples (Lesson 3)

- **Array Typing (Inference):** TypeScript infers the common type(s) contained in the array (e.g., `string[]` or a union type like `(string | number)[]`).
- **Union Type Arrays:** The union type must be wrapped in parentheses, e.g., `(string | number)[]`. TypeScript allows elements to be reassigned to any type within the union, and it does not enforce element order or array length.
- **Empty Array Typing:** An empty array `let test = [];` defaults to `any[]`. You must explicitly state the intended type for strictness, e.g., `let bands: string[] = [];`.
- **Tuples:** Define a rigid array that is **locked into a specific type in a specific element position and a specific length**. They are more strict than arrays. A non-tuple array (which does not enforce length) cannot be assigned to a tuple that requires a specific length.

### Objects, Types, and Interfaces (Lesson 3)

- **Generic `object` Type:** Declaring a variable as type `object` (`let myObject: object;`) allows assignment to any object, **including arrays**, because arrays are objects in JavaScript.
- **Type Aliases (`type` keyword):** Used to define the _shape_ of an object or to alias complex union types. Cannot be used to alias non-object types if defining a new interface.
- **Interfaces (`interface` keyword):** Also used to define the _shape_ of an object. The speaker suggests using interfaces for defining structures that resemble classes. Interfaces use a different syntax than type aliases (no `=`).

|Property Feature|Syntax / Usage|
|:--|:--|
|**Required Property**|`name: string;`|
|**Optional Property**|`active?: boolean;` (Type becomes `boolean|
|**Adding New Property**|Cannot be done to a predefined type/interface structure after definition.|

### Classes (Lesson 6)

Classes use interfaces for implementation (e.g., `class Guitarist implements Musician`).

|Feature|Syntax / Usage|Detail|
|:--|:--|:--|
|**Constructor**|Used to instantiate the class. Must call `super()` in subclasses before assignment.|Constructors can use default parameter values, making those arguments optional.|
|**Properties**|Must be declared in the class body _and_ assigned in the constructor (unless using a Visibility Modifier).|Can be defined with an assertion (`property!: Type`) if uninitialized.|
|**Public (Default)**|Accessible anywhere.|Can be explicitly stated: `public name: string`.|
|**Private**|Accessible **only within the class itself**.|Must be accessed via a public method (e.g., a getter) from outside the class.|
|**Protected**|Accessible within the class **and derived subclasses**.|Cannot be accessed directly on the instance outside the class hierarchy.|
|**Readonly**|Prevents modification after initial assignment.|Can be combined with `public`.|
|**Static Members**|Defined with `static` keyword.|Apply directly to the class (e.g., `Peeps.count`), not instances.|
|**Getter**|Uses `get` keyword (e.g., `get data(): string[]`).|Makes a private property publicly read-only if no setter is provided.|
|**Setter**|Uses `set` keyword (e.g., `set data(value: string[])`).|**Cannot return a value**. Useful for adding validation/type checking logic before updating state.|

## Type Assertion and Dynamic Access (Lessons 5 & 7)

### Type Assertion (Type Casting) (Lesson 5)

Type Assertion is when the developer explicitly tells the TypeScript compiler what type a value is, overruling or guiding inference.

- **`as` keyword:** The primary syntax used in TSX/React projects.
    - Can convert to a **less specific type** (e.g., `string as string | number`).
    - Can convert to a **more specific type** (e.g., `string as "hello"`).
- **Angle Brackets (`<>`):** An alternative syntax, but **cannot be used in TSX files (React)**.
- **Caution:** Assertion is dangerous because you are telling TS you know better; if you are wrong, bugs will occur at runtime.
- **Forced Casting (Double Assertion):** `value as unknown as Type` is used to intentionally bypass strict checks, first converting the value to the generic `unknown` type.
- **Non-Null Assertion:** Adding an exclamation mark (`!`) after a variable (e.g., `element!`). It asserts the value is definitely not `null` or `undefined`.
- **DOM Assertions:** Crucial when using `document.querySelector` or `getElementById`, as TS infers the result might be `null` or a generic `HTMLElement`. Assertion ensures type safety: `document.getElementById('id') as HTMLSpanElement`.

### Index Signatures (Lesson 7)

Index signatures are required when accessing object properties **dynamically** (e.g., using a variable for the key, common in `for...in` loops).

|Feature|Syntax / Usage|Detail|
|:--|:--|:--|
|**Basic Index**|`interface T { [key: string]: number; }`.|Defines that all keys are strings and all values are numbers. Keys must be `string`, `number`, `symbol`, or template literals.|
|**Required Properties**|Can be combined with specific required properties to improve safety.|If used with specific properties, the index value type must be a union of all possible property types (including `undefined` for optional properties).|
|**`keyof` Assertion**|Allows dynamic iteration through an object _without_ an index signature.|`object[key as keyof InterfaceName]`. `keyof` creates a union of literal string names.|

---

## Generics (Lesson 8)

Generics use a type variable (placeholder, usually `T`) to allow a function, interface, or class to work with any data type while maintaining type safety.

- **Syntax:** The type variable is declared in angle brackets: `function Echo<T>(arg: T): T`.
- **Narrowing/Constraints (`extends`):** Generics can be constrained to ensure they adhere to a minimum structure.
    - Example: `<T extends HasID>` ensures that `T` is an object with an `id` property.
- **Complex Constraints:** Multiple type variables can be used together with `keyof` to ensure one variable (`K`) is a valid key of another type (`T`).
    - Example: `<T extends HasID, K extends keyof T>`.
- **Generic Classes:** Used for structures like state management objects where the type of the managed data is only known on instantiation.
    - Instantiation: `new StateObject<string | number[]>(value)`. If no type is provided explicitly, TS infers the type from the initial value and enforces it thereafter.

## Utility Types (Lesson 9)

Utility types facilitate common type transformations.

|Utility Type|Description|Usage Context|
|:--|:--|:--|
|**`Partial<T>`**|Makes all properties in `T` optional.|Useful for update functions where only a subset of props is needed.|
|**`Required<T>`**|Makes all properties in `T` required (removes optionality).|Used to enforce mandatory presence of optional fields.|
|**`Readonly<T>`**|Makes all properties in `T` read-only.|Prevents modification of object properties.|
|**`Record<K, T>`**|Constructs an object type with keys `K` and values `T`.|**Very popular**. Useful because keys (`K`) can be defined using **string literal union types** (unlike traditional index signatures).|
|**`Pick<T, K>`**|Creates a type by selecting specified properties `K` from type `T`.|Applied to Interfaces/Type Aliases.|
|**`Omit<T, K>`**|Creates a type by omitting specified properties `K` from type `T`.|Applied to Interfaces/Type Aliases.|
|**`Exclude<T, U>`**|Constructs a type by excluding specified members `U` from a Union Type `T`.|Applied only to Union Types.|
|**`Extract<T, U>`**|Constructs a type by extracting specified members `U` from a Union Type `T`.|Applied only to Union Types.|
|**`NonNullable<T>`**|Constructs a type by removing `null` and `undefined` from `T`.|Useful for narrowing possible states.|
|**`ReturnType<T>`**|Extracts the return type of a function type `T`.|Used to derive types automatically, which updates if the function signature changes.|
|**`Parameters<T>`**|Extracts the function parameters into a **tuple** type.|The resulting tuple can be spread when calling the function.|
|**`Awaited<T>`**|Extracts the result type of a Promise (removes the `Promise<>` wrapper).|Useful when working with `fetch` functions or asynchronous data retrieval.|

## TypeScript in React: Vite, Components, and Hooks

The source covers integration with React using **Vite** ("Veet").

### Vite Setup and Project Structure (Lesson 10)

- **Project Creation:** `npm create vite@latest` (select React and TypeScript variant).
- **Execution:** `npm run dev` (starts the development server).
- **Development Files:** Uses `main.tsx` and `app.tsx` extensions.
- **Environment Variables:** Types are set in `vite-env.d.ts`. Variables are accessed via `import.meta.env` (not `process.env`).

### Component Typing (Lesson 12)

- **Props Typing:** Props should be defined using `type PropsType = { ... }` and passed into the functional component signature.
- **Avoiding `React.FC`:** Use of `React.FC` or `React.FunctionalComponent` is discouraged (or deprecated in later React 18 versions) because it implicitly handles children, which can be inconsistent with strict TS checks.
- **Children Typing (Crucial for React 18+):** Children must be **explicitly defined** in the component's props interface.
    - Type: `children: ReactNode` (or a more specific type like `ReactElement | ReactElement[]`).
- **Default Props (Modern Way):** Avoid `Component.defaultProps`. Assign defaults directly during destructuring, e.g., `({ title = "My Subheading" })`.
- **Dynamic Image Import (Vite/React):** The old Node `require()` method does not work with Vite. Use the `URL` object and `import.meta.url` to get a dynamic string path: `new URL(\`../images/${product.sku}.jpg`, import.meta.url).href`.

### React Hooks with TypeScript (Lesson 13)

|Hook|Typing Method|Detail / Use Case|
|:--|:--|:--|
|**`useState`**|Generics (`useState<Type>`) or Union Types (`useState<Type|null>`).|
|**`useEffect` / `useLayoutEffect`**|Returns `void`.|Minimal TS usage as they handle side effects. React 18 strict mode causes mount/unmount/remount in dev mode.|
|**`useCallback`**|Explicit event typing required for callback parameters (e.g., `MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>`) to avoid implicit `any`.|Memoizes functions; handler functions should be wrapped in `useCallback` to maintain referential equality.|
|**`useMemo`**|Explicit generics optional (`useMemo<number>`).|Memoizes the return **value** of an expensive function/calculation.|
|**`useRef`**|Explicitly type the DOM element (`useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null)`).|Access to `.current` requires optional chaining (`?.`) or non-null assertion (`!`) because it starts as `null`.|

### Advanced Hooks and State Management (Lessons 14 & 15)

- **`useReducer`:** Used for complex state logic involving multiple values. Requires careful definition of **initial state type**, **action types** (e.g., const enum or string literal object), and the **reducer signature**. The reducer must handle optional payloads and potential `undefined` states (e.g., using the nullish coalescing operator `??`).
- **`useContext`:** Used to organize state and logic by app feature.
    - **Context Structure:** Reducer logic, initial state, and handlers are extracted into a separate context file.
    - **Custom Hook:** A custom hook (`useCounterContext`) is created within the context file to encapsulate `useReducer` and all handler logic. This hook's return type defines the context shape (using `ReturnType<typeof customHook>`).
    - **Provider:** The Provider component wraps the components that need access to the state. It passes the values obtained from the custom hook into the `value` prop.
    - **Specialized Hooks:** Further custom hooks (e.g., `useCounter`, `useCounterText`) can be created to deliver only specific portions of the state/logic needed by a component.

### Optimization with Memoization (Lesson 17)

- **`memo` (React):** Used to wrap functional components to prevent unnecessary re-renders (a performance optimization technique).
- **Custom Comparison Function:** When passing object props (like an entire `item` or `product`), the default `memo` shallow comparison fails because the object has new referential equality on every render.
- **`areItemsEqual` Logic:** A custom comparison function must be passed as the second argument to `memo`. This function compares the `prevProps` and `nextProps` objects using `Object.keys(prev).every(...)` and asserts the keys are of the correct type (`key as keyof CartItemType`) for type safety. This ensures the component only re-renders if a deep property value changes.
