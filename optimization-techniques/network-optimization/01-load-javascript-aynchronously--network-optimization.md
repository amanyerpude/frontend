## System Design: Asynchronously Loading JavaScript

This topic is part of a larger series covering **basic to advanced system design principles** for frontend engineers, which are crucial for successfully completing frontend interviews. Key concepts in this series include **network optimization**, optimizing image assets, fast rendering, and virtualization. The focus here is specifically on how to **asynchronously load JavaScript**.

When the browser processes an HTML file, three main stages related to script loading are considered:

1. **Parsing:** The construction of the **DOM tree**.
2. **Downloading/Fetching:** The browser makes a **network call** to fetch the JavaScript code.
3. **Execution:** The downloaded JavaScript code is run.

There are four primary ways or scenarios discussed for loading JavaScript, which significantly impact when and how these stages occur:

---

### 1. Basic Approach: Script Tag After the Body Tag

This is often considered the very basic approach.

|Timeline Effect|Description|
|:--|:--|
|**Parsing**|The browser starts parsing the HTML and continues until it reaches the end of the body tag.|
|**Download**|After the body tag is completed, the browser encounters the script tag. Parsing stops, and the browser makes a network call to download the script.|
|**Execution**|Once the download is finished, the script is executed.|
|**Assessment**|This approach ensures that the **HTML parsing happens first**. However, the fetching (network call) only begins **after the parsing is finished**.|

---

### 2. Standard Approach: Script Tag Inside the Head Tag

Placing the script tag inside the `<head>` is common but presents significant performance issues.

|Timeline Effect|Description|
|:--|:--|
|**Parsing Blockage**|Parsing starts, but the moment the browser encounters the script tag in the head, **HTML parsing stops there**. The construction of the DOM tree is halted.|
|**Download & Execution**|The browser downloads the JS, then executes the JS.|
|**Resumption**|Only after the download and execution are fully completed does the browser resume and continue parsing the rest of the HTML (body, end of HTML).|
|**Assessment**|This approach is **blocking HTML parsing**. This is considered a **very bad user experience** and is less optimized than placing the script after the body tag.|

---

### 3. Optimized Approach using `async` Attribute

To optimize the blocking behavior seen when scripts are in the head, the `async` attribute can be used. The script tag remains inside the head tag.

|Timeline Effect|Description|
|:--|:--|
|**Simultaneous Download**|When the browser encounters the script tag with `async`, it **simultaneously starts downloading the JS** (fetching the JavaScript code from the network).|
|**Parsing During Download**|Crucially, because of the `async` attribute, the **parsing is not stopped** while the download (fetching) is happening. This is an improvement over the previous approach.|
|**Parsing During Execution**|When the download is completed, HTML parsing is **paused** again so that the browser can execute the JS code.|
|**Resumption**|Parsing resumes after execution is complete.|
|**Assessment**|While `async` prevents parsing from stopping during the download phase, the **execution still pauses HTML parsing**. Pausing parsing, even during execution, is not ideal for a good user experience.|

---

### 4. Optimized Approach using `defer` Attribute

The `defer` attribute is an alternative optimization applied while the script tag is kept in the head.

|Timeline Effect|Description|
|:--|:--|
|**Simultaneous Download & Parsing**|The `defer` attribute instructs the browser to download the script and **continue the parsing** simultaneously. The browser fetches the JavaScript from the network and holds it.|
|**Execution Timing**|The execution of the JS code only occurs **after the browser finishes parsing** and has reached the end of the document, meaning the DOM tree has been generated.|
|**Assessment**|This is generally the **most optimal approach**. **Parsing is not paused** at all. We are performing **pre-fetching** of the JavaScript code during the parsing phase.|
|**Performance Benefit**|The download of JavaScript is prioritized during the parsing phase, ensuring the JS code is available in memory **much sooner** than in the body-tag approach. This pre-fetching helps **improve network performance**.|

### Interview Strategy and Comparison

A common interview question is: "**Where do we place a script tag in the HTML and why?**". The interviewer's goal is typically to guide the interviewee toward explaining the optimal use of the `defer` attribute.

#### Recommended Answer Flow:

1. Start by acknowledging the traditional approach: placing the script tag after the body tag so that downloading and execution occur after parsing is completed.
2. Introduce the improvement: Explain that using the **`defer` attribute** on a script tag placed in the header allows for better performance.
3. Explain **`async` and `defer`** in detail.
4. Provide the critical comparison point: **Execution**.
    - **Async** blocks parsing during execution.
    - **Defer** does not block parsing during execution, as the execution only starts after parsing is entirely complete.
5. Conclude that **`defer` is better than `async`** because it ensures parsing finishes. The overall network performance is optimized by **pre-fetching** the necessary JavaScript code during the parsing phase.
